DESCRIPTION
    Header file for the SWAT profile library. The library exposes a functional
    downstream API and an upstream message based API.

/*!
@file   swat.h
@brief  Interface to the Subwoofer Audio Transfer Profile library.

        When a device wishes to start streaming subwoofer audio content, the 
        device must first setup a streaming connection. During the stream setup,
        the devices select between either standard or low latency media channel.
        
        
        Once a streaming connection is established and the start streaming
        procedure is executed, audio can be streamed from the Source (SRC)
        to the Sink (SNK).

        This library provides the low level services to permit an audio stream
        to be configured, started, stopped and suspended.  This library
        provides the stream configuration and control.  The actual streaming of
        data is performed by the underlying firmware.  The audio stream is
        routed to the Digital Signal Processor (DSP) present on CSR BlueCore
        Multimedia devices.  The CPU intensive operation of encoding/decoding a
        media stream is performed by the DSP.

        The library exposes a functional downstream API and an upstream message
        based API.
