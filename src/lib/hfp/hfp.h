    @brief Configuration parameters passed into the hfp profile library in
    order for an Hfp profile instance to be created and initialised.

    The library client (usually the application) must specify the profile to be
    supported. In the case of hands free it must also specify the set of
    supported features for that profile instance. Optionally, the client may
    also supply a service record. If the service_record pointer is set to null
    the default service record provided by the hfp library is used. If however
    the pointer is non null, this client supplied service record is used. The
    hfp library will still insert the correct rfcomm channel number into the
    service record but it will perform no other error checking on the record
    provided.  The client provided service record may be fairly large so the
    hfp library will not attempt to take a local copy of the data. For the
    moment the hfp library assumes that the service record pointer is in const
    or that the client will not free the pointer for the lifetime of the
    application.

    support. This can be headset profile, one of the hansfree profiles, or
    both headset profile and one of the handsfree profiles.

    @brief Initialise an instance of the HFP library.

    @param theAppTask The current application task.

    @param config Profile supported (HSP or HFP) plus any supported features.

    The application registers its own task, theAppTask, with the HFP library so
    that return messages can be routed to the correct task.

    The config parameter is used to configure the profile this HFP instance
    will support (HSP or HFP). If the HFP is being supported the supported
    features should also be supplied. These are passed in as a bit mask, as
    defined in the HFP specification. If the profile instance is being
    configured as HSP the supported features should be set to zero as they are
    not used.

    @param extra_indicators Additional indicators the AG may support.

    The HFP defines three indicators, (service, call and call_setup) that the
    AG must send to the HFP device. However, the GSM specification defines a
    number of other indicators the AG may support. The application can use
    extra_indicators to specify that it wants to be notified whether the AG
    supports a particular indicator and of its index in the CIND response.
    
    The extra_indicators should be specified as a string with carriage returns
    (\r) separating each indicator. For example, the extra_indicators string
    might looks as follows, "battchg\rroam\rsounder". It is important that
    spaces are not inserted into the string. The application will be notified
    of the indicator's index (if it is supported by the AG) using a
    HFP_EXTRA_INDICATOR_INDEX_IND message.

    If extra indicator reporting is enabled then all indicator updates will be
    passed to the application (using a HFP_EXTRA_INDICATOR_UPDATE_IND message)
    and not just the indicators the application has registered an interest
    in. It is left up to the application to determine whether the indicator
    update is of interest. On SLC establishment the HFP lib will send AT+BIA 
    to the AG and will attempt to disable any extra indicators not included in 
    extra_indicators, in addition to those disabled in hfp_init_params, as HFP 
    assumes the application is not interested in them. Most applications will 
    not want to enable extra indicators, in which case extra_indicators should 
    be set to null.
    
    
    The application will receive an HFP_INIT_CFM message from the library to
    indicate the success or otherwise of the initialisation.
