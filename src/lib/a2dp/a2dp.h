DESCRIPTION
    Header file for the A2DP profile library. The library exposes a functional
    downstream API and an upstream message based API.

*/
/*!
@file   a2dp.h
@brief  Interface to the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile library.

        When a device wishes to start streaming audio content, the device must
        first set up a streaming connection.  During the stream setup, the
        devices select the most suitable audio streaming parameters.
        Application service capability and transport service capability are
        configured during this stream setup procedure.

        Once a streaming connection is established and the start streaming
        procedure is executed, audio can be streamed from the Source (SRC)
        to the Sink (SNK).

        This library provides the low level services to permit an audio stream
        to be configured, started, stopped and suspended.  This library
        provides the stream configuration and control.  The actual streaming of
        data is performed by the underlying firmware.  The audio stream is
        routed to the Digital Signal Processor (DSP) present on CSR BlueCore
        Multimedia devices.  The CPU intensive operation of encoding/decoding a
        media stream is performed by the DSP.

        The library exposes a functional downstream API and an upstream message
        based API.
