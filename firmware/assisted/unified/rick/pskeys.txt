==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_BDADDR (0x0001)

SUMMARY
	Bluetooth address

TYPE
	bdaddr

DEFAULT VALUE
	{ 0x00A5A5, 0x5b, 0x0002 }

DESCRIPTION
	The local device's Bluetooth address.  This should be unique to this
	device. It is allocated during manufacturing.
	
	The type bdaddr can be viewed as a uint16[4] array:
	
	        1st uint16:     The top 8 bits of the LAP are in the bottom 8
	                        bits of this word. The top 8 bits of this word
	                        must be zero.
	        2nd uint16:     The lower 16 bits of the LAP
	        3rd uint16:     The 8-bit UAP is in the bottom 8 bits of this
	                        word. The top 8 bits of this word must be
	                        zero.
	        4th uint16:     16-bit NAP
	
	For example, the Bluetooth address 123456789abc is encoded as 0078,
	9abc, 0056, 1234.
	
	The default value of this key is one of CSR's legal addresses:
	00025b00a5a5.
	
	As stated in the Bluetooth specification, LAP values from 9e8b00 up
	to, and including, 9e8b3f must not be used as this range is reserved
	for inquiry access codes (IACs).
	
	Bluetooth module manufacturers must obtain their own block of
	addresses from the Bluetooth SIG/IEEE. If CSR's experience is
	typical, these authorities define the NAP and UAP, allowing
	manufacturers to set the 24-bit LAP.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_CLASSOFDEVICE (0x0003)

SUMMARY
	Class of device

TYPE
	bdcod

MINIMUM
	(0)

MAXIMUM
	(0xffffff)

DEFAULT VALUE
	(0)

DESCRIPTION
	The local device's default Bluetooth "Class of Device" or CoD.
	
	Type bdcod is really a uint32. The class of device is a 24-bit
	value stored in a uint32; the highest byte must be zero.
	
	This is the device's default class of device, used when the device
	boots. The device's class of device may subsequently be changed by
	an HCI command. The HCI command does not change the value stored
	under this PSKey.
	
	The least significant two bits reveal the format of the other 22
	bits. The only format currently defined is for where the two
	bits are zero:
	
	  Bits     Content
	  [1:0]    Format Type (0)
	  [7:2]    Minor Dev Class (in the context of the Major Dev Class)
	  [12:8]   Major Dev Class
	  [23:13]  Major Service Class
	
	At the time of writing, the firmware makes no use of this information.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_DEVICE_DRIFT (0x0004)

SUMMARY
	Device drift

TYPE
	uint16

MAXIMUM
	(250)

DEFAULT VALUE
	(250)

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey holds the local device's radio timing drift in parts per
	million. The maximum value allowed by the Bluetooth specification
	is 250.
	
	This value is used in LMP_timing_accuracy_res messages sent to
	peers, as described in Bluetooth version 1.1, LMP specification,
	section 5.2. It is also used in calculations in low power modes
	to decide for how long the radio on a slave device must be turned on
	in order to resynchronise with a remote master: reducing the value
	therefore allows power saving.
	
	The default value is appropriate when BlueCore's internal low power
	oscillator is in use to maintain timing during low power modes, i.e.  
	for the default setting of PSKEY_DEEP_SLEEP_STATE
	(DEEP_SLEEP_ALWAYS, value 1) and PSKEY_DEEP_SLEEP_USE_EXTERNAL_CLOCK
	(FALSE). The appropriate values for the various settings of these
	PSKeys are:
	
	PSKEY_DEEP_SLEEP_STATE = NEVER or INACTIVE (0 or 2): set device drift
	to 20 ppm to reflect full Bluetooth clock accuracy.
	
	PSKEY_DEEP_SLEEP_STATE = ALWAYS (1): if
	PSKEY_DEEP_SLEEP_USE_EXTERNAL_CLOCK is FALSE, set device drift to 250
	ppm (default). If an external clock is in use, set
	device drift to the accuracy of that external clock.
	
	PSKEY_DEEP_SLEEP_STATE = ALWAYS_ACCURATE (3):
	if PSKEY_DEEP_SLEEP_USE_EXTERNAL_CLOCK is TRUE, set device drift to
	the accuracy of the external slow clock.
	
	Note: Some BlueCore7 and later parts can internally derive a slow
	clock from their fast clock and so the accuracy will be much
	better than 250 ppm. See comments in PSKEY_DEEP_SLEEP_STATE.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_DEVICE_JITTER (0x0005)

SUMMARY
	Device jitter

TYPE
	uint16

DEFAULT VALUE
	(10)

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey holds the local device's radio jitter in microseconds.
	(LMP v1.1, section 5.2.)
	
	This value is used in LMP_timing_accuracy_res messages sent to
	peers.  This is the only use for this PSKey.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_MAX_ACLS (0x000d)

SUMMARY
	Maximum ACL links

TYPE
	uint16

MINIMUM
	(0)

MAXIMUM
	(40)

DEFAULT VALUE
	MAX_NUM_ACLS

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey holds the maximum number of concurrent ACL connections to
	other devices.
	
	Links to remote devices use substantial amounts of RAM to maintain
	connection state, so this value should be kept low. It is
	advisable to trim this value to match the application, allowing any
	liberated RAM to be used elsewhere. The value must be reduced
	if the chip is running any of the higher layers of the Bluetooth
	stack because these take from the common supply of RAM.
	
	On 23h and later firmware, reducing this key can allow the malloc
	space freed up to be put into larger pools for VM applications. See
	the descriptions of PSKEY_PMALLOC_PER_ACL and PSKEY_PMALLOC_BASE for
	more information. (This key has no direct effect on malloc usage for
	earlier firmware.)

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_MAX_SCOS (0x000e)

SUMMARY
	Maximum SCO links

TYPE
	uint16

MINIMUM
	(0)

MAXIMUM
	(3)

DEFAULT VALUE
	MAX_NUM_SCOS

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey holds the maximum number of SCO links to (all) other
	devices.
	
	On 23h and later firmware, reducing this key can allow the malloc
	space freed up to be put into larger pools for VM applications. See
	the descriptions of PSKEY_PMALLOC_PER_SCO and PSKEY_PMALLOC_BASE for
	more information. (This key has no direct effect on malloc usage for
	earlier firmware.)
	
	This value may be reduced to increase the buffer space available for
	ACL data: see the description of PSKEY_H_HC_FC_MAX_ACL_PKT_LEN.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_MAX_REMOTE_MASTERS (0x000f)

SUMMARY
	Maximum remote masters

TYPE
	uint16

MINIMUM
	(1)

MAXIMUM
	(2)

DEFAULT VALUE
	(2)

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey holds the local device's maximum number of remote piconet 
	masters.
	
	Connecting to multiple remote masters implies the use of scatternets.
	The current firmware supports one permanent remote master, plus a
	second remote master in a temporary state either for performing a
	remote name request or to connect by a role switch to become a slave.
	
	See the description of PSKEY_ENABLE_MASTERY_WITH_SLAVERY.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_ENABLE_MASTERY_WITH_SLAVERY (0x0010)

SUMMARY
	Support master and slave roles simultaneously

TYPE
	bool

DEFAULT VALUE
	(TRUE)

DESCRIPTION
	If this PSKey is set to TRUE (value 1) then the firmware is configured
	to support being a master of its own piconet at the same time as being
	a slave in one or more other piconets. This implies the use of
	scatternets.
	
	This value is constrained by the value of the PSKey
	PSKEY_MAX_REMOTE_MASTERS.
	
	The "barge-in" connection sequence (an existing master page-scans,
	it is paged by new a device, then the new device's link performs
	a master/slave switch) implies a temporary scatternet.  This PSKey
	does not effect this behaviour.
	
	See the description of PSKEY_MAX_REMOTE_MASTERS.
	
	(Type bool is fundamentally a uint16 with values 0 and 1 mapping to
	FALSE and TRUE.)

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_H_HC_FC_MAX_ACL_PKT_LEN (0x0011)

SUMMARY
	Maximum HCI ACL packet length

TYPE
	uint16

MINIMUM
	(1)

MAXIMUM
	(512)

DEFAULT VALUE
	(310)

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey holds the maximum acceptable length, in bytes, of the data 
	portion of HCI ACL data packets received from the host. This is
	reported by the HCI_Read_Buffer_Size HCI command as the
	HC_ACL_Data_Packet_Length value.
	
	You may want to tune this value to obtain better device throughput.
	However, you must keep constant the product of the values of this key
	and of total number of host packets. Because this effectively
	reserves a block of the device's valuable RAM for use by the host.
	
	For each SCO connection 1024 bytes of memory is reserved and if the
	max number of SCO connections (N)= PSKEY_MAX_SCOS is reduced by 1
	from its firmware default, the effective total memory for ACL and
	fastpipe packets may be increased by 1024 bytes.
	
	On parts that do not support ram reserve feature total number of
	host packets is taken from PSKEY_H_HC_FC_MAX_ACL_PKTS. On these
	parts, if B = PSKEY_H_HC_FC_MAX_ACL_PKTS,
	L = PSKEY_H_HC_FC_MAX_ACL_PKT_LEN, and S is product B * L, when
	these keys have their firmware default values then the following
	four conditions must be satisfied if these keys are altered:
	
	If the parts support EDR:
	1. B * L <= S
	2. B * L <= 3968
	3. (B + 1) * L <= 4095
	4. B <= 14
	
	If the parts do not support EDR:
	1. B * L <= S
	2. B * L <= 1919
	3. (B + 1) * L <= 2047
	4. B <= 14
	
	On parts that support ram reserve feature, total memory reserved for
	host (PSKEY_MMU_TRACKED_BYTES) is sum of buffers for ACL packets,
	buffers for fastpipe packets and SCO buffers. On these following are
	the parameters used to determine the max number of ACL packets.
	-> T = Tokens set by allocate_ram_reserve BCCMD
	-> B = HC_Total_Num_ACL_Data_Packets returned by HCI_Read_Buffer_Size
	       HCI command (which includes T) + PSKEY_RESERVE_INIT_TOKENS
	-> L = PSKEY_H_HC_FC_MAX_ACL_PKT_LEN
	-> N = PSKEY_MAX_SCOS
	
	With above parameters following conditions must be satisfied if these
	keys are altered:
	
	1. (B * L) + (N * 1024) <= PSKEY_MMU_TRACKED_BYTES (6236)
	2. B * L <= 4032
	3. (B + 1) * L <= 4095
	4. B <= 14
	
	Violating any of these conditions may cause the chip to crash or
	behave oddly. CSR only supports configurations that meet all four
	of these conditions.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_H_HC_FC_MAX_SCO_PKT_LEN (0x0012)

SUMMARY
	Maximum HCI SCO packet length

TYPE
	uint8

MINIMUM
	(1)

MAXIMUM
	(128)

DEFAULT VALUE
	(64)

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey holds the maximum acceptable length, in bytes, of the data 
	portion of HCI SCO data packets received from the host. This supports
	the HCI_Read_Buffer_Size HCI command.
	
	You may want to tune this value to obtain better device
	throughput. However, you must keep constant the product of the values
	of this key and of PSKEY_H_HC_FC_MAX_SCO_PKTS because this effectively
	reserves a block of the device's valuable RAM for use by the host.
	
	Only change this value after careful consideration: small values
	will heavily load the (host and) chip processor(s), and large
	values will normally increase audio latency.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_H_HC_FC_MAX_SCO_PKTS (0x0014)

SUMMARY
	Maximum number of HCI SCO packets

TYPE
	uint16

MINIMUM
	(1)

MAXIMUM
	(14)

DEFAULT VALUE
	(8)

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey holds the maximum number of HCI SCO data packets being sent
	to air that can be held within the chip at any time.
	
	This supports the HCI_Read_Buffer_Size HCI command.
	
	See the description of PSKEY_H_HC_FC_MAX_SCO_PKT_LEN.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_LC_FC_BUFFER_LOW_WATER_MARK (0x0015)

SUMMARY
	Flow control low water mark

TYPE
	lc_fc_lwm

DEFAULT VALUE
	{0x0600, 0x0700, 0x0800}

DESCRIPTION
	This PS Key holds a set of values that control the assertion of flow 
	control for data received from air.
	
	The LC determines how much buffer memory has been promised to
	the host for host to air traffic, then it adds the safety margins
	set by this key and compares the result with the available free
	buffer memory. The result determines when and how the LC applies
	flow control for data received from air.
	
	This PSKey holds an array of three values. Each value sets a behaviour
	threshold, measured in a number of bytes:
	
	        0: Received data is discarded and a NAK is returned
	        1: ACL flow control is asserted
	        2: L2CAP flow control is asserted
	

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_LC_MAX_TX_POWER (0x0017)

SUMMARY
	Maximum transmit power

TYPE
	int16

MINIMUM
	(-128)

MAXIMUM
	(127)

DEFAULT VALUE
	(20)

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey holds the device's maximum transmit power in dBm.
	
	The firmware ensures the device never speaks more loudly than this
	value.
	
	The firmware uses the highest value in the power table that is less
	than or equal to the requested default power.
	
	Correct operation depends on having a valid power table - see
	PSKEY_LC_POWER_TABLE.
	
	The maximum value depends on the Bluetooth module class:
	
	        Class 1:  0  to +20 dBm.
	        Class 2:  -6 to +4  dBm.
	        Class 3:  up to 0   dBm.
	
	Unlike most PSKey values, this is a *signed* 16-bit integer.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_TX_GAIN_RAMP (0x001d)

SUMMARY
	Transmit gain ramp rate

TYPE
	uint16

MINIMUM
	(4)

MAXIMUM
	(0xffff)

DEFAULT VALUE
	(0x1810)

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey holds the device's transmitter gain ramp rate. It controls 
	the power ramp-up at the start of a packet and ramp-down at the end of
	a packet.
	
	CSR recommends that this value is not modified from the default.
	
	Bits [7:0] control the ramp rate. The normal range is between 0x04
	and 0x3F. Values below 0x04 are out of spec and must not be used.
	
	Bits [15:8] control the length of the unmodulated carrier between the 
	end of the ramp and the start of the packet in microseconds.
	
	The ramp rate value has different effects according to whether the 
	module uses the chip's internal power amplifier or an external 
	amplifier. (See PSKEY_TXRX_PIO_CONTROL.)
	
	If the internal power amplifier is ramped then the microseconds taken
	to complete the ramp is 
	   (4*amplifier_setting)/ramp_rate.
	
	If an external power amplifier is ramped then the microseconds taken
	to complete the ramp is 
	   (amplifier_setting)/ramp_rate
	
	In both cases amplifier_setting is taken from the power table 
	PSKEY_LC_ENHANCED_POWER_TABLE (PSKEY_LC_POWER_TABLE on older BlueCore
	devices where EDR is not supported).
	
	The total time controlled by this PS key is
	    ramp_time (calculated as above) + unmodulated_carrier_time

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_LC_FC_POOLS_LOW_WATER_MARK (0x0020)

SUMMARY
	Flow control pool low water mark

TYPE
	lc_fc_lwm

DEFAULT VALUE
	{0x0014, 0x0018, 0x001a}

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey is similar to PSKEY_LC_FC_BUFFER_LOW_WATER_MARK, but
	describes numbers of available pool memory blocks.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_LC_DEFAULT_TX_POWER (0x0021)

SUMMARY
	Default transmit power

TYPE
	int16

MINIMUM
	(-128)

MAXIMUM
	(127)

DEFAULT VALUE
	(4)

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey holds the radio's default transmit power, measured in dBm. 
	The chip uses this for page, inquiry and their scan responses. This is
	also the power used for new connections.
	
	In 12.X builds the firmware uses the entry in the power table that is
	closest to this PSKey's value. If the two closest power tables are
	equidistant from this key's value then it is indeterminate which
	power table entry is used.
	
	In 13.X and later builds the firmware uses the highest value in the
	power table that is less than or equal to the requested default
	power.
	
	Correct operation depends on the the device having a valid power
	table - see PSKEY_LC_POWER_TABLE.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_LC_MAX_TX_POWER_NO_RSSI (0x002d)

SUMMARY
	Maximum transmit power when peer has no RSSI

TYPE
	int8

DEFAULT VALUE
	(4)

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey value is used after a connection is made, if it is found
	that a remote device does not support RSSI measurements or the local
	device does not support power control. The transmit power is lowered
	to correspond to the first entry in PSKEY_LC_POWER_TABLE whose power
	in dBm is less than or equal to the value of this PSKey.
	
	According to the Bluetooth specification, a device may only
	transmit to a receiving device that does not support the necessary
	messaging for sending the power control messages
	using the rules for a class 2 or class 3 device, in other
	words, with a maximum transmit power of 4 dBm, hence the default value
	for this PSKey. This allows the default transmit power to be raised
	above 4 dBm without violating the specification.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_LC_CONNECTION_RX_WINDOW (0x002e)

SUMMARY
	Receive window size during connections

TYPE
	uint16

DEFAULT VALUE
	(10)

DESCRIPTION
	The Bluetooth specification requires that a master or slave is
	sensitive to timing jitter of transmissions from the other side up to
	10 microseconds while the two devices are connected. The value may be
	controlled by this PSKey.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_BT_CLOCK_INIT (0x0034)

SUMMARY
	Initial value of Bluetooth clock

TYPE
	uint32

MAXIMUM
	(0xfffffffUL)

DEFAULT VALUE
	(0UL)

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey holds the value to which the Bluetooth clock is initialised
	at boot. The value 0 is standard; the only likely reason to alter this
	is for debugging non-CSR devices known to encounter problems at
	certain clock values.
	
	Historical note:  before this key was introduced, CSR devices
	initialised their Bluetooth clocks from the lower 28 bits of the
	Bluetooth address, i.e. the lower 4 bits of the UAP followed by
	the LAP.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_CONDITIONAL_SCAN_ENABLE (0x0036)

SUMMARY
	Enable conditional scan

TYPE
	bool

DEFAULT VALUE
	(FALSE)

DESCRIPTION
	If this PSKey is set to TRUE (value 1), the firmware rapidly scans the
	Bluetooth band on the first slot pair of a page or inquiry scan,
	looking for any transmissions in the band. If it finds none, it does
	not listen for the remaining scan window. The intention is to save
	power when there are no other devices nearby.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_TX_MR_MOD_DELAY (0x0038)

SUMMARY
	TX Mod delay

TYPE
	uint8

DEFAULT VALUE
	(0x59)

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey holds mod delay for Tx.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_RX_MR_SYNC_TIMING (0x0039)

SUMMARY
	RX MR Sync Timing

TYPE
	uint16

DEFAULT VALUE
	(0x463F)

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey holds trim timing for EDR sync.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_RX_MR_SYNC_CONFIG (0x003a)

SUMMARY
	RX MR Sync Configuration

TYPE
	uint16

DEFAULT VALUE
	(0x0024)

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey holds acceptable correlation quality of EDR.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_LC_LOST_SYNC_SLOTS (0x003b)

SUMMARY
	Time in ms for lost sync in low power modes

TYPE
	uint16

MAXIMUM
	(0x7fff)

DEFAULT VALUE
	(0)

DESCRIPTION
	In low power modes, a device considers it has lost synchronisation
	with its peer if it fails to receive an expected transmission in one
	of the following circumstances:
	
	- In sniff mode as a slave, during any sniff window when nothing
	is received.
	
	- In sniff mode as a master, during any sniff window when the slave
	has been sent a POLL or a data packet and no reply has been
	received.
	
	- In park mode as a slave, when no transmission is received on any
	park beacon in a train.
	
	This PSKey specifies a value in baseband slots (units of 625 us) which
	must elapse since the last packet received from the remote device
	before the logic described above applies.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_RX_MR_SAMP_CONFIG (0x003c)

SUMMARY
	RX MR Sync Configuration

TYPE
	uint16

DEFAULT VALUE
	(0x0426)

DESCRIPTION
	Acceptable correlation quality of EDR

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_NO_CAL_ON_BOOT (0x0042)

SUMMARY
	Do not calibrate radio on boot

TYPE
	bool

DEFAULT VALUE
	(FALSE)

DESCRIPTION
	Set this PSKey to TRUE to cause the LC not to calibrate the radio at
	boot time. This means that the radio does not work until the key is
	set to false and the chip is rebooted. This key is intended to allow
	the use of a bootmode where the radio is disabled. For details on
	bootmodes, see the CSR document "Understanding and Using Bootmodes",
	CS-101528-AN (previously numbered as bcore-an-019P),
	on the CSR support website.
	
	Type bool is fundamentally a uint16 with values 0 and 1 mapping to
	FALSE and TRUE.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_RSSI_HI_TARGET (0x0043)

SUMMARY
	RSSI high target

TYPE
	uint8

DEFAULT VALUE
	(80)

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey controls a parameter used by BlueCore's automatic gain
	control (AGC) algorithm. Do not change it except on specific advice
	from CSR.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_LC_ENABLE_LATE_SAMPLE (0x004b)

SUMMARY
	Enable late data sampling for transmission

TYPE
	bool

DEFAULT VALUE
	(TRUE)

ENUM_INCLUDE_FILE
	bt.h

ENUM_VALUES
	 TRUE (1)   Enabled
	FALSE (0)   Disabled

DESCRIPTION
	This key controls when the LC should sample if data is available
	for transmission.  If enabled the LC samples as late as possible
	for data being available.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_LC_CLOCKS_CONFIG (0x004f)

SUMMARY
	Miscellaneous Bluetooth hardware clock config

TYPE
	uint16

DEFAULT VALUE
	(0)

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey enables miscellaneous configuration of hardware clocks for 
	Bluetooth.
	
	Do not change this PSKey except on specific advice from CSR.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_EDR_SWITCH_MODE (0x0051)

SUMMARY
	EDR power amp, assertion method  

TYPE
	edr_switch_mode

DEFAULT VALUE
	(HIGH_TO_LOW)

ENUM_INCLUDE_FILE
	io_bt.h

ENUM_VALUES
	HIGH_TO_LOW   high to low transition on pio pin
	LOW_TO_HIGH   low to high transition on pio pin

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey holds the EDR_SWITCH_MODE which is used to describe the 
	assertion method for the EDR_SWITCH_MODE_PIO and is used to set up
	the driving method, Low To High or High To Low.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_EDR_MODE_SWITCH_PIO (0x0052)

SUMMARY
	EDR PA support on pio(x) 

TYPE
	uint16

DEFAULT VALUE
	<none>

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey asserts the PIO line specified, 0-15 if present. If 
	the PSKey is not present it becomes a zero-length key with 
	an attempt to read it failing. This fails the psget method 
	and disables use of this key. If the PSKey is defined but the value 
	is 0xffff, out of bounds, then the key does not set up a PIO line. 
	Using this PSKey is intended to be the mode select line for 
	an EDR power amp. The assertion method is in 
	PSKEY EDR_SWITCH_MODE and will be either high to low or low to 
	high.
	
	If a PIO line is required for Tx enabling then you should use 
	PSKEY_TXRX_PIO_CONTROL, pio pin 1 which asserts when transmitting.

SUMMARY
	Peer transmit power control interval

TYPE
	TIME

MINIMUM
	(0)

MAXIMUM
	(60 * SECOND)

DEFAULT VALUE
	(100000)

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey is the period, measured in microseconds, between attempts
	to increment the peer's transmit power. 
	
	Set this PSKey to zero to disable the periodic checks. This means the
	local device does not send messages concerning power management or 
	channel quality driven data rate to the remote device. This PSKey
	is paired with decrement peer power period.
	
	Type TIME is fundamentally a uint32.  Value SECOND is 1000000.
	Value MILLISECOND is 1000.

NAME
	PSKEY_LC_PEER_POWER_DECR_PERIOD (0x0058)

SUMMARY
	Peer transmit power control interval

TYPE
	TIME

MINIMUM
	(100000)

MAXIMUM
	(60 * SECOND)

DEFAULT VALUE
	(1 * SECOND)

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey is the period, measured in microseconds, between attempts
	to decrement the peer's transmit power. The same interval is used for 
	measurements of channel quality to support LMP channel quality driven
	data rate messages.
	
	This PSKey is paired with the respective increment peer power period.
	This key has a minimum value of 100 ms. However it is disabled if the 
	increment peer power period is set to 0. This means the local device
	does not send messages concerning peer power management.
	
	Type TIME is fundamentally a uint32.  Value SECOND is 1000000.
	Value MILLISECOND is 1000.

NAME
	PSKEY_LC_HIGH_PRIORITY_SNIFF_TIMEOUTS (0x0060)

SUMMARY
	High priority bandwidth for sniff timeout slots

TYPE
	bool

DEFAULT VALUE
	(FALSE)

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey affects the algorithm that selects the value of Dsniff when
	negotiating sniff mode for an ACL connection.  If no value is set or
	the value is FALSE, sniff timeout slots are not included in the
	calculation unless the quality of service for the connection is
	"guaranteed". If the value is TRUE, sniff timeout slots are always
	taken into account: this means that extra spacing is left in the
	air time schedule, where possible, to allow for a transmission to a
	slave during one iteration of the timeout slots.
	
	This PSKey has no direct effect on the real-time scheduling of links
	in sniff mode, so it does not necessarily cause a master to address
	the slave in the timeout slots. A QoS setting of "guaranteed" for an
	ACL connection causes sniff timeout slots to be treated as high
	priority by the real-time scheduler. However, use this with caution
	because it can have a significant effect on the bandwidth available
	for other links.
	
	Type bool is fundamentally a uint16 with values 0 and 1 mapping to
	FALSE and TRUE.

SUMMARY
	Local supported features block

TYPE
	uint16[4]

DEFAULT VALUE
	{ 0xffff, 0xfe8f, 0xffdb, 0x875b }

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey holds a 4-element array of uint16s holding a bitfield that 
	describes the features supported by the local device for page 0 of the
	device features bits mentioned in the LMP specification.
	
	See PSKEY_LOCAL_SUPPORTED_FEATURES_PAGE_2 for the page 2 features.
	Note that PSKEY_LOCAL_SUPPORTED_FEATURES_PAGE_2 is only present
	in BlueCore firmware images which support page 2 features.
	
	Coding matches the "coding of features" section in the LMP
	specification. The first byte of the coding of features is held in
	the lower byte of the first uint16, etc.
	
	The key's default value gives the firmware's capabilities. Switching
	a bit from 0 to 1 does not create a missing capability.
	
	This PSKey configures the local LM. If a feature is marked as provided
	by the default value, then clearing the key's bit turns off the
	corresponding functionality. For example, setting the Encryption bit
	to zero stops the local device supporting encryption.
	
	The three "flow control lag" bits should be left at zero.
	
	The order in 1.2 of the specification is:
	
	First word, low to high (X => turned on in default config;
	(X) => turned on if supported by hardware;)

DESCRIPTION
	By default the BlueCore firmware sends an HCI command_status(NOP)
	event to the host shortly after booting. Although this is clearly
	allowed by the HCI specification it is known to crash some host
	stacks.
	
	This PSKey provides a simple workaround: if this key is TRUE then

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_LM_TEST_SEND_ACCEPTED_TWICE (0x00f6)

SUMMARY
	LM sends two LMP_accepted messages in test mode

TYPE
	bool

DEFAULT VALUE
	(FALSE)

DESCRIPTION
	The Bluetooth v1.1 specification does not ensure reliability of LMP
	traffic in test mode, because it does not differentiate test packets
	(which are unreliable) from LMP packets at the baseband level. This
	can lead to loss of LMP messages.
	
	If this PSKey is set to TRUE, a slave in test mode sends the
	LMP_Accepted reply to a test control message twice. This increases
	the likelihood that the message will be received by the tester. (It
	does not guarantee it because, as the link manager does not operate
	in real time, there may be test messages in between the
	transmissions.)
	
	Type bool is fundamentally a uint16 with values 0 and 1 mapping to
	FALSE and TRUE.

DESCRIPTION
	Each time a unit pages a new device and it currently has active links,
	they are held for page timeout slots. If page timeout slots is greater
	than this PSKey value, this value is used a the maximum hold time.
	A value of zero indicates that holding around page is disabled.

DEFAULT VALUE
	(0x12c0)

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey sets the interval between successive channel classification
	updates (and hence channel map adaptations) for an AFH enabled master.
	The period is measured in baseband slots (625us), and is between 1 and
	30 seconds.
	
	The slave classification intervals sent in the
	LMP_channel_classfication_req message are derived from this value:
	    AFH_max_interval = this_value
	    AFH_min_interval = this_value / 2

NAME
	PSKEY_AFH_OPTIONS (0x00f9)

SUMMARY
	Options to configure AFH

TYPE
	uint16

DEFAULT VALUE
	(0x0017)

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey allows you to configure AFH. The bits are not restricted to
	classification, as follows:
	 Bit 0 enable RSSI classification
	 Bit 1 enable PLR classification
	 Bit 2 enable use of combo information in classification
	 Bit 3 <reserved>
	 Bit 4 enable hysterisis of the classifications from slaves
	 Bit 5 disable RSSI classification with "low power" links
	 Bit 6 enable extended RSSI classification with "low power" links,
	       this enables the time period for RSSI classification to be
	       PSKEY_AFH_RSSI_LP_RUN_PERIOD.
	
	RSSI - BlueCore makes signal strength measurements of channels not
	being used by the Bluetooth link when the radio would otherwise be
	idle. In ideal radio conditions, this increases the power 
	consumption during a connection. However, it has the advantage that 
	it makes Bluetooth a good neighbour; it identifies and avoids other 
	users of the ISM band even if they are not causing problems for 
	Bluetooth operation and can return channels to use when the 
	interferer is no longer present. Power consumption can be reduced 
	with interference present as there is a reduced need for 
	message retransmissions. CSR recommends that RSSI is enabled.
	
	When all links are "low power", power consumption for RSSI
	classification can be reduced by not performing RSSI scans (setting
	Bit 5), or performing them less regularly (setting Bit 6 and setting
	PSKEY_AFH_RSSI_LP_RUN_PERIOD larger than PSKEY_AFH_RSSI_RUN_PERIOD).
	"Low power" links are in sniff or park with a period of more than 128
	slots. (This value was chosen to distinguish sniff periods used in HID
	devices from those used by, for example, idle headsets.)
	
	Note: A link is never considered to be "low power" if it has a SCO
	or eSCO link associated with it, so that adding an (e)SCO link to a
	sniffed link immediately restarts or speeds up classification when
	using Bits 5 or 6 of this PSKey.
	
	PLR - Dropped packets and bit error rates for FEC encoded headers and
	payloads are used to estimate the interference for each of the
	channels being used. This gives priority to channels that are
	degrading the Bluetooth performance. As mentioned above, it does not
	identify other users of the ISM band unless they are corrupting
	Bluetooth packets, and it does not rapidly detect the removal of an
	interferer on a channel being avoided. Additionally, BlueCore can 
	only apply this method when it is master of the link.
	
	To use AFH functionality to avoid interference, at least one device in
	the link must include a classifier.

NAME
	PSKEY_AFH_RSSI_RUN_PERIOD (0x00fa)

SUMMARY
	AFH RSSI reading period

TYPE
	uint16

MINIMUM
	(50)

MAXIMUM
	(0xFFFF)

DEFAULT VALUE
	(500)

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey sets the period with which the LC schedules an RSSI
	classification. When this period has passed, and there is a gap in
	Bluetooth activity, the Bluetooth radio is used as a spectrum analyser
	to read the RSSI on all Bluetooth channels. These values are averaged
	and decay slowly.
	
	Note: Bit 6 of PSKEY_AFH_OPTIONS allows a longer period to be used
	for links in sniff and park. See the descriptions of PSKEY_AFH_OPTIONS
	and PSKEY_AFH_RSSI_LP_RUN_PERIOD for more information.
	
	The value of this PSKey is in units of ms.

	This PSKey determines the amount of time it takes for a channel that
	was marked as bad to be marked as good again (when there is no further
	information about that channel). The time is approximately Key *
	40 milliseconds. The actual time varies, as reintroduction is
	deliberately randomised. The fastest possible time is 25% of this
	time.
	
	In the presence of broadband signals, the time to mark the channels 
	affected by these signals is increased. This reduces the 
	chance of further interference from the broadband source - which may 
	be caused by beacons or varying data transfer on the broadband signal.
	
	Channels are typically marked as unknown much sooner than this.  
	AFH selection algorithms may use this as a hint to use the 
	channel sooner.
	
	The value of this PSKey is in units of 40 ms.

NAME
	PSKEY_NO_DROP_ON_ACR_MS_FAIL (0x00fc)

SUMMARY
	Complete link if acr barge-in role switch refused

TYPE
	bool

DEFAULT VALUE
	(TRUE)

DESCRIPTION
	If the Role parameter to the HCI Accept_Connection_Request (acr)
	command is 0x00 it requires the local device to become master of the
	link. This means requesting the existing (paging) master to
	perform a role switch, and only completing the connection if the
	switch is performed. The link is dropped if the request to perform a
	role switch is refused. You can configure the HCI Set_Event_Filter 
	command to achieve the same behaviour without involving the host
	via Connection_Request.
	
	Set the PSKey to TRUE to alter this behaviour: if the Role
	parameter is 0x00 then it is treated as advice - the local device
	requests the paging master to perform a role switch, but the link is
	not dropped if this is refused. The behaviour of the event filter is
	similarly adjusted. No attempt is made to hide a failure to switch.
	For example, no Role_Change event is sent to the host.
	
	This PSKey attempts to fix situations where both devices insist on 
	being master. However, it changes the behaviour of HCI, so there is no
	guarantee that a given host stack will behave correctly. You must 
	determine the correct system operation.
	
	If this PSKey is FALSE, the firmware provides the normal HCI
	behaviour.
	
	Type bool is fundamentally a uint16 with values 0 and 1 mapping to
	FALSE and TRUE.

NAME
	PSKEY_LOCAL_SUPPORTED_COMMANDS (0x0106)

SUMMARY
	Local supported commands

TYPE
	uint16[9..32]

DEFAULT VALUE
	{0xffff, 0x03ff, 0xfffe, 0xffff, 
                         0xffff, 0xffff, 0x0ff3, 0xfee8,

                         0x0000}

DESCRIPTION
	
	This PSKey holds a large bitfield (in little-endian format) that 
	describes which HCI commands are supported by the host controller. 
	The Host finds out this information by trying the command. The Host
	Controller then returns with "Unknown HCI Command", but some
	Hosts might prefer to try this command first.
	
	The result returned by this command does not change after the Host
	Controller has booted. Sometimes it is not possible for the Host
	Controller to perform some operations (eg. insufficient resources or
	not having a link of the correct type).  This command still implies
	that the commands are available; if the Host tries such a command the
	Host Controller should return a different status message than "Unknown
	HCI Command".

NAME
	PSKEY_DEVICE_NAME (0x0108)

SUMMARY
	Local device's "user friendly" name

TYPE
	uint16[]

MAXIMUM
	(40)

DEFAULT VALUE
	{0x5343, 0x2052, 0x202d, 0x6362, 0x0037}

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey holds the local device's default "user friendly" name, 
	used by the HCI Read_Local_Name and Change_Local_Name commands and by
	LMP_name_req/LMP_name_res transactions.
	
	When the firmware is booted, the device's name is taken from this
	PSKey. However, if the local host alters the local device's name, by
	calling the HCI Change_Local_Name command, then the new name is held
	in RAM. Subsequent requests to read the device's name take from the
	RAM store, not from this PSKey. The PSKey's value only becomes
	visible again after the firmware reboots.
	
	The Bluetooth v1.1 HCI specification requires the device's default
	name to be ""; an empty string. The default (psrom) value of this
	PSKey is "CSR - bc3" or similar. Therefore, the psrom value does not
	meet the HCI specification. If this PSKey is set to hold nothing,
	i.e., no uint16s are stored under the PSKey, then the HCI default
	value is obtained.
	
	Over HCI and LMP the name is passed as a sequence of UTF-8 octets.
	Because the PS stores data in arrays of uint16s, the name is packed
	in this PSKey, two octets per uint16. This packing is important when
	the PS store is small, notably where the PS is held in EEPROM.
	
	Working from the start of the device's name, the first character is
	stored in the lower octet of the PSKey's first uint16, the second
	character in the upper octet of the first uint16, etc. If the name
	is an odd number of characters then the upper octet of the last
	uint16 is '\0'.
	
	This PSKey can hold a maximum of 20 uint16s, limiting the default
	device name to 40 octets. The behaviour is undefined in this PSKey
	holds more than 20 uint16s. (This size constraint does not apply to
	a name written via the HCI Change_Local_Name command.)
	
	The default name for BlueCore3 chips is "CSR - bc3"; when packed this
	becomes {0x5343, 0x2052, 0x202d, 0x6362, 0x0033}.
	
	This PSKey is used from (HCI) 18.X builds.  HCI 17.X and earlier
	builds use PSKEY_LOCAL_NAME0 -> PSKEY_LOCAL_NAME17 and
	PSKEY_LOCAL_NAME_LENGTH.

NAME
	PSKEY_AFH_RSSI_THRESHOLD (0x0109)

SUMMARY
	AFH RSSI threshold

TYPE
	uint16

DEFAULT VALUE
	(0x0400)

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey holds a value that controls the threshold of the entire 
	RSSI classification algorithm. If the standard deviation of the power 
	in the band is below this level then the device assumes that the
	entire band is clear and adapts its channel ratings accordingly.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_LM_CASUAL_SCAN_INTERVAL (0x010a)

SUMMARY
	Scan interval in slots for casual scanning

TYPE
	uint16

DEFAULT VALUE
	<none>

DESCRIPTION
	If this PSKey is set and is non-zero, `casual scanning' is enabled.
	The value then gives a maximum interval in slots between page and
	inquiry scans.
	
	In this mode, page and inquiry scans are not necessarily performed
	with the frequency of the intervals set via
	HCI_write_inquiry_scan_activity and HCI_write_page_scan_activity.  If
	the chip is active at any point after the interval specified over HCI
	since the previous scan, it performs the scan of the appropriate
	type. If it does not become active within
	PSKEY_LM_CASUAL_SCAN_INTERVAL slots after the previous scan, it 
	performs the scan at that point.
	
	On chips prior to BlueCore3-ROM, casual wakeup relies on the chip
	being woken up for some other reason, either by the host or due to an
	internal timer.
	
	Casual wakeup is most useful on hardware starting with BlueCore3-ROM.
	This contains support for waking the chip from deep sleep if the host
	provides a clock. In this case, if the host provides a clock at any
	time after the normal scan interval, the chip wakes to perform the
	scan in synchronisation with the host. Otherwise, it waits until
	PSKEY_LM_CASUAL_SCAN_INTERVAL slots have elapsed and wake anyway.
	
	For this reason you should only set this PSKey when the host provides
	a clock input that goes low when the chip enters deep sleep.
	Otherwise there is a significant peformance impact as the chip
	is woken unnecessarily. 
	
	On chips from BlueCore3-ROM but before BlueCore4-ROM, the key is also 
	only useful with host transports that do not use 
	PSKEY_UART_SLEEP_TIMEOUT as the chip stays awake for that period if 
	woken by a host clock. This is likely to be a source of considerable
	inefficiency. On chips from BlueCore4-ROM, the firmware distinguishies
	wakeups caused by the presence of the host clock from those caused by
	data on the UART, so this restriction does not apply.
	
	Casual scanning is not used in continuous page scan, because in this
	case the chip never becomes inactive.
	
	If casual scanning is in use, the link manager reports the
	scan repetition mode based on the larger of the page scan interval
	and the casual scan interval.

NAME
	PSKEY_AFH_MIN_MAP_CHANGE (0x010b)

SUMMARY
	The minimum amount to change an AFH map by

TYPE
	uint16[2]

DEFAULT VALUE
	{ 2, 4 }

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey defines the minimum amount by which the device changes a
	channel map. If the channel map is rapidly changing by only a very
	small amount then the device prefers not to send too many channel map
	changes of classification reports.
	
	The first number is the number of channels that must have got worse to
	cause the device to send a message. The second number is the number
	of channels that must have improved to cause the device to send a
	message. Having the second number bigger than the first means that the
	device will send messages more frequently as things become worse (as
	it knocks out more channels). The device then only adds channels
	back in as things become better.
	
	Setting either value to zero disables this feature - the device
	sends the channel map message whenever the channel map changes.
	
	The 'all good' channel map is a special case: the device always
	sends this.

NAME
	PSKEY_AFH_RSSI_LP_RUN_PERIOD (0x010c)

SUMMARY
	AFH RSSI reading period when in low power mode

TYPE
	uint16

MINIMUM
	(50)

MAXIMUM
	(0xFFFF)

DEFAULT VALUE
	(5000)

DESCRIPTION
	The value of this PSKey is used in place of PSKEY_AFH_RSSI_RUN_PERIOD
	when all Bluetooth links are in a "low power" mode (see the
	description of PSKEY_AFH_OPTIONS for the definition of "low power").
	Therefore, this key is normally much larger than 
	PSKEY_AFH_RSSI_RUN_PERIOD to reduce power when links are in sniff or 
	park.
	
	This period is enabled by Bit 6 in PSKEY_AFH_OPTIONS.
	The value of this PSKey is in unit of ms.

SUMMARY
	The HCI and LMP version reported locally

TYPE
	uint16

MINIMUM
	(0)

MAXIMUM
	(0xFFFF)

DEFAULT VALUE
	(0x0707)

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey holds the HCI_version and LMP_version information reported
	to the local host when the host sends
	HCI_Read_Local_Version_Information. The HCI_Version is the top 8 bits,
	the LMP_Version is the bottom 8 bits.

DEFAULT VALUE
	(0x07)

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey holds the LMP_version information reported in
	LMP_version_res to the remote host when the remote host sends
	LMP_version_req. The LMP_Version is the bottom 8 bits.

NAME
	PSKEY_CONDITIONAL_SCAN_BACKOFF_TIME (0x010f)

SUMMARY
	Conditional scan backoff time

TYPE
	TIME

MINIMUM
	(0)

MAXIMUM
	(1073741824)

DEFAULT VALUE
	(30000000)

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey sets the period in microseconds for which conditional
	scanning is disabled when the leaky bucket reaches
	PSKEY_CONDITIONAL_SCAN_BACKOFF_LEVEL. See that PSKey's description for
	how the leaky bucket works.
	
	The firmware also stops conditional scanning for this period when it
	receives an inquiry or when the last connection has just ended,
	returning the firmware to the idle state. Conditional scanning is
	never performed in the connected state.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_CONDITIONAL_SCAN_BUCKET_BOTTOM (0x0110)

SUMMARY
	Conditional scan leaky bucket bottom

TYPE
	int8

MINIMUM
	(-126)

MAXIMUM
	(0)

DEFAULT VALUE
	(-10)

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey value provides a clip on the minimum level of the leaky 
	bucket used to manage the power use of the conditional scan. The
	closer this value is to zero, the less a history of radio inactivity
	matters when deciding whether to conditional scan.
	
	See the description of PSKEY_CONDITIONAL_SCAN_BACKOFF_LEVEL for a
	description of the leaky bucket mechanism.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_CONDITIONAL_SCAN_BUCKET_BACKOFF_LEVEL (0x0111)

SUMMARY
	Conditional scan leaky bucket backoff level

TYPE
	int8

MINIMUM
	(0)

MAXIMUM
	(127)

DEFAULT VALUE
	(10)

DESCRIPTION
	When using conditional scan, if the radio environment is busy,
	performing the conditional scan plus the ordinary page/inquiry scan
	uses more power than conditional scan alone. To turn off
	conditional scan when the radio environment is busy, the LM uses a
	leaky bucket filter.
	
	The bucket level is incremented by 1 whenever the conditional scan
	detected a radio source, and decremented by an amount that depends on
	the scan window and interval when the conditional scan did not detect
	a radio source. The decrement amount is calculated to keep the level
	at zero at the percentage chance of radio activity where conditional
	scanning uses an equal amount of power to not conditional scanning.
	When the level rises above zero, it is becoming inefficient to
	conditional scan. When the level goes below zero (possible as the
	level is a signed value), it is more efficient to conditional scan
	than not to.
	
	When the bucket level reaches the value of this PSKey, conditional
	scanning is disabled for the period of time given by
	PSKEY_CONDITIONAL_SCAN_BACKOFF_TIME. It is then re-enabled with the
	bucket level set back to zero.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_CONDITIONAL_SCAN_BACK_TO_BACK_OPTIMISE (0x0112)

SUMMARY
	Conditional scan back to back optimisation

TYPE
	bool

DEFAULT VALUE
	(TRUE)

DESCRIPTION
	When page scan and inquiry scan have the same interval, to save power
	the scans are done back-to-back, with inquiry scan first and
	then page scan. When this PSKey is True, if the inquiry scan was a
	conditional scan and the conditional scan heard nothing, the following
	page scan is not performed. Conversely, if the inquiry scan was a
	conditional scan and heard something, the following page scan is never
	a conditional scan, but always an ordinary page scan. This PSKey is
	best used when the scan window is short compared to the scan interval.
	
	When this key is False, the conditional scanning from page and inquiry
	are not coupled in this way, although both still contribute to the
	leaky bucket which decides whether to conditional scan.
	
	This PSKey only has an effect if conditional scan is enabled using
	PSKEY_CONDITIONAL_SCAN_ENABLE.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_ERROR_CODE_LTADDR_EXHAUSTION (0x0114)

SUMMARY
	Error code to be used when we run out of LT_ADDRs

TYPE
	uint8

DEFAULT VALUE
	(0x09)

DESCRIPTION
	The BlueTooth specification is not clear about which HCI
	error code should be used if a device runs out of LT addresses when
	it has fewer than the maximum allowed number of ACL connections (see
	PSKEY_MAX_ACLS). This can happen if a connection is lost without a
	clean disconnect taking place; the device then reserves the
	address that the connection was using for some amount of time.
	
	If an attempt is made to create an ACL connection, for example
	to perform a remote name request or service search, when the device
	has fewer than PSKEY_MAX_ACLS existing ACL connections but has no
	available LT_ADDRs, the value of this PSKey is returned in the HCI
	command complete event. 
	
	Note: The value of this key does not get validated at all. However, 
	CSR recommends only using the following values:
	
	- Connection Limit Exceeded (0x09)
	  This is the same error code as that returned if PSKEY_MAX_ACLS is
	  exceeded. Because this value is ambiguous, it is unsuitable for some
	  hosts.
	
	- Memory Capacity Exceeded (0x07)
	  This error code is also returned if the device runs out of RAM and
	  suggests to the host that the attempt should succeed if the host
	  first performs an operation that frees up some RAM. As freeing
	  RAM does not help in the case of LT_ADDR exhaustion, this error
	  code is misleading and so unsuitable for some hosts.
	
	- Connection Rejected due to Limited Resources (0x0d)
	  This error code is meant to suggest that the connection has been
	  rejected by the remote device but, in this case, the connection
	  has been rejected by the local device so this error code is not
	  correct.
	
	- Unspecified Error (0x1f)
	  The most suitable of the defined error codes but not specific
	  to this error condition.

NAME
	PSKEY_SP_ENABLE_ECC_KEY_CHANGES (0x0115)

SUMMARY
	Enable ECC key protection by changing keys

TYPE
	bool

DEFAULT VALUE
	(FALSE)

DESCRIPTION
	When enabled, this key will cause the BlueCore device to change the 
	public/private keypair intermittently in line with guidance from the
	Bluetooth specification.
	This provides protection against some forms of attacks on the DH key
	exchange procedure.

NAME
	PSKEY_SP_STORE_GENERATED_ECC_KEY (0x0116)

SUMMARY
	Store ECC keys genereted during Simple Pairing

	If this PSKey is set to TRUE then any ECC keys generated during Simple
	Pairing are written into PSKEY_SP_ECC_KEY.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_SP_ECC_KEY (0x0117)

SUMMARY
	ECC P192 Key Pair

TYPE
	uint16[]

DEFAULT VALUE
	<none>

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey sets a P192 ECC Simple Pairing Key Pair. If this PSKey is
	set, BlueCore will not generate a key pair but instead use the one 
	provided in this PSKey. 
	The valid format is as follows:
	[private key length][private key][public key X length][public key X]
	[public key Y length][public key Y]
	
	where X and Y are the first and second halves of the public key 
	respectively. The length fields specify the number of used words
	in the respective key field (i.e. after stripping MS zero words) -
	The actual size of the fields are fixed.
	
	The keys should be split into 16-bit words and programmed least
	significant word first. 
	
	For example, a 32-bit key: 0791 5f86
	
	becomes: 5f86 0791 
	
	It is important that this template must be followed exactly otherwise 
	the PSKey will be disregarded with no warning or error message 
	returned.
	
	Warning: Setting this key to the debug values as specified by the
	Bluetooth Core Specification is considered insecure as an 
	active/passive attacker that has access to the debug private key
	can proceed to eavesdrop on all encrypted traffic between the hosts 
	and perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack.
	
	This key should only be altered on the advice of CSR.
	
	If PSKEY_SP_STORE_GENERATED_ECC_KEY is set to TRUE then any generated
	key pairs will be written to this PSKey.
	
	There is a PSKEY_SP_ECC_P256_KEY which is the equivalent of this PSKey
	but for storage of P256 key pairs. 
	The two keys are not dependent on one another.

	BLE local supported features

TYPE
	uint16[4]

DEFAULT VALUE
	{ 0x0001, 0x0000, 0x0000, 0x0000 }

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey contains a 4-element array of uint16s holding a bitfield
	that describes the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) features supported by
	the local device.
	
	Currently only the first word is being used (from the LSB upwards) 
	as defined in the BLE feature set as per the specification. The
	remaining bits are currently unused.
	
	The PSKey's default value gives the firmware's capabilities. Switching
	a bit from 0 to 1 does not create a missing capability.
	
	This PSKey configures the local LM. If a feature is marked as provided
	by the default value, then clearing the PSKey's bit turns off the
	corresponding functionality. For example, setting the Encryption bit
	to zero stops the local device supporting encryption.
	
	The bit order as per the specification is:
	
	First word, low to high
	  Bit     Feature
	  0       LE Encryption
	  1       Connection Parameters Request Procedure
	  2       Extended Reject Indication

NAME
	PSKEY_AFH_BLE_MIN_MAP_CHANGE (0x011f)

SUMMARY
	The minimum amount to change a BLE AFH map by

TYPE
	uint16[2]

DEFAULT VALUE
	{ 2, 4 }

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey defines the minimum amount that the device changes
	the BLE channel map when it is the master of a connection. If the
	channel map is rapidly changing by only a very small amount then the
	device prefers not to send too many channel map updates to the slave.
	
	The first value is the number of channels that must have worsened to
	cause the device to send a message. The second value is the number
	of channels that must have improved to cause the device to send a
	message. Having the second number bigger than the first means that
	the device sends messages more frequently as things become worse
	(as it knocks out more channels), and less frequently as things
	become better (minimising false positives).
	
	Setting either value to zero disables this feature. The device
	sends the channel map message every time the channel map changes.
	
	The 'all good' channel map is a special case: the device always
	sends this.

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey defines the absolute maximum number of advert filters that
	can be set by either a VM application or by using the bccmd

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey controls internal link manager behaviour. Do not change
	it except on specific advice from CSR.
	This PSKey exists to disable specific BLE and  BR/EDR role
	combinations that are prohibited by the Generic Access Profile.
	Enabling this PSKey will allow the prohibited role combinations,

DESCRIPTION
	If TRUE this PSKey enables the use of DFU. I.e. support for DFU is
	advertised in the USB descriptors and DFU commands are
	processed. Otherwise support for the protocol is not
	advertised and DFU commands are rejected.
	
	This PSKey applies to both the USB and "DFU over UART" (protocol name
	not yet allocated) protocols. It is intended for use in countries
	such as Japan where firmware upgrades may not be allowed for radio
	devices.
	
	Type bool is fundamentally a uint16 with values 0 and 1 mapping to

DEFAULT VALUE
	{ 
                        1,      /* 1 to enable link sync. */

                        250     /* Tshy is 250ms. */ }

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey configures the BCSP link establishment protocol. This is 
	only used if BCSP is used over the chip's UART.
	
	The configuration uses a structure of type BCSP_LM_PS_BLOCK where 
	fields are:
	
	      uint16  mode           0:  disable link establishment.
	                             1:  enable link establishment.
	                             2:  enable passive-start link
	                                 establishment.  This option causes
	                                 the link establishment engine on the
	                                 device to emit no messages until it
	                                 receives traffic from the host.  
	
	      uint16  sync_retries   Support for this argument has been
	                             removed.
	
	                             It used to set the number of sync
	                             packets emitted before the BCSP
	                             link establishment engine gave up
	                             and marked the link as dead.  A
	                             value of zero meant "don't stop."
	                             The BCSP link establishment engine
	                             now always behaves as if the value
	                             is zero.
	
	      uint16  tshy           The Tshy value in milliseconds.
	
	                             This is the interval in which the BCSP
	                             link establishment engines send "sync"
	                             messages.  This value is also used by the
	                             BCSP link establishment engine's
	                             Tconf timer.

NAME
	PSKEY_HOSTIO_PROTOCOL_INFO0 (0x0194)

SUMMARY
	Host transport channel 0 settings (BCSP ACK)

TYPE
	PROTOCOL_INFO

DEFAULT VALUE
	{ 
                        0,      /* max_tx_payload_size. */ 
                        FALSE,  /* reliable_stream. */ 
                        0,      /* priority. */ 
                        0       /* unused - must be 0. */ }

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey configures the protocol that flows over BCSP channel 0.
	
	The host transport subsystem provides 16 channels, each of which is
	configured by a PROTOCOL_INFO struct held in the persistent store.
	
	BCSP channel 0 is dedicated to signalling between BCSP stacks, 
	specifically to carry message acknowledgements. Therefore, it is not
	available as a channel to carry user messages through BCSP, and is 
	used by the BCSP host transport only.  
	
	While channel 0 is not available, the structure described below is
	used for the other channels in the host transport subsystem.
	
	The type PROTOCOL_INFO has the following fields:
	
	        uint16 max_tx_payload_size - The maximum size in bytes of
	                BCSP payload sent to the host.  For ACL and SCO the
	                actual maximum size will be the lower of the value
	                from PS and the value indicated to the BlueCore 
	                device in the host's HOST_BUFFER_SIZE command, if one 
	                has been received.  These values are checked at run
	                time against the size of hardware buffer allocated.
	
	        int:1 reliable_stream - TRUE (bit value of 1) if the protocol 
	                uses BCSP's reliable stream.
	
	        int:4 priority - A value between 0 and 7.  Lower values
	                have higher priority.  The priority is used by the
	                device's BCSP scheduler when deciding what data to
	                send to the host.
	
	        int:1 enabled - TRUE (bit value of 1) if the protocol is 
	                enabled. The current design of the firmware code 
	                requires each protocol to be enabled explicitly 
	                internally by the firmware, so this flag should 
	                always be FALSE.
	
	The last three fields are packed as bitfields in the second word, as 
	shown below:
	
	      Bits
	       [9:0]    Unused (second byte plus lower 2 bits)
	       10       enabled
	       [14:11]  priority
	       15       reliable_stream

	This PSKey configures the UART's reset counter timeout in
	microseconds.
	
	If the UART's receive data line is held low for this period then the
	chip's (hardware) resets itself. Accuracy is +/- 30%, so it is
	important to specify to the nearest microsecond. 
	
	If this value is zero then the feature is disabled.
	
	Values between 1 and 999 are treated as zero.
	
	This feature only works with the UART host transports: BCSP, H4, H5
	and VM access to the UART.
	
	If PSKEY_HOSTIO_UART_RESET_TIMEOUT is set then make sure
	PSKEY_UART_BITRATE or PSKEY_UART_BAUDRATE is set to a non-zero value.
	Otherwise the chip will try autobaud detect and it will not move
	to deep sleep until UART_BREAK is removed.
	
	Type TIME is fundamentally a uint32.

NAME
	PSKEY_HOSTIO_USE_HCI_EXTN (0x01a5)

SUMMARY
	Use hci_extn to route non-hci channels

TYPE
	bool

DEFAULT VALUE
	(FALSE)

DESCRIPTION
	If the system is using BCSP and this PSKey is FALSE then the non-HCI
	BCSP channels (currently 7: BCCMD, HQ, 4 higher layer access libs and
	the VM's channel) are routed via their BCSP channels. Otherwise, they
	are routed via hci_extn, described in CSR document "BlueCore HCI 
	Extensions", CS-101682-SP, available from the CSR support website.
	
	If the system is using H4 or USB then these channels are always
	routed over hci_extn.
	(Type bool is fundamentally a uint16 with values 0 and 1 mapping to
	FALSE and TRUE.

NAME
	PSKEY_HOSTIO_USE_HCI_EXTN_CCFC (0x01a6)

SUMMARY
	Use command-complete flow control for hci_extn

TYPE
	bool

DEFAULT VALUE
	(FALSE)

DESCRIPTION
	If the system is using hci_extn to carry the non-HCI channels (see
	the description of PSKEY_HOSTIO_USE_HCI_EXTN) and this key is TRUE
	then the chip emits an "hci command complete event" for each HCI
	manufacturer extension command.
	
	Set this PSKey to TRUE so that the host->chip data flow through
	hci_extn fits most closely to the HCI flow control model. However,
	this also means the hci_extn channel has glacial performance. If this
	is FALSE then the hci_extn traffic depends (only) on the tunnelled
	channels' own flow control mechanisms.
	
	Type bool is fundamentally a uint16 with values 0 and 1 mapping to
	FALSE and TRUE.

NAME
	PSKEY_HOSTIO_HCI_EXTN_PAYLOAD_SIZE (0x01a7)

SUMMARY
	Maximum hci_extn payload size

TYPE
	uint16

MINIMUM
	(2)

MAXIMUM
	(255)

DEFAULT VALUE
	(255)

DESCRIPTION
	If the system is using hci_extn to carry the non-HCI channels (see
	the description of PSKEY_HOSTIO_USE_HCI_EXTN) then this value
	specifies the maximum size of the HCI event payloads when primitives
	on non-HCI channels are fragmented. This PSKey value is the size of 
	the HCI event payload, where one byte is used for the HCI-extn 
	payload descriptor. Therefore each fragment is, at most, one byte less
	than this value. The minimum value for this PS value is therefore 2,
	though such a low value is likely to give extremely poor
	performance. The maximum value is 255 (because the length field in
	the HCI event header is only 8 bits wide).
	
	Set this value lower than the maximum expected payload size to
	force hci_extn to fragment. This can be good when the host
	connection carries time-critical traffic, notably SCO.

NAME
	PSKEY_BCSP_LM_CNF_CNT_LIMIT (0x01aa)

SUMMARY
	BCSP link establishment conf message count

TYPE
	uint16

DEFAULT VALUE
	(20)

DESCRIPTION
	The value of this PSKey is only used if PSKEY_USE_OLD_BCSP_LE is
	set to TRUE.
	
	Most early versions of the BCSP Link Establishment engine detected
	only that the peer BCSP stack had started - this is what the protocol
	was designed to do, as the protocol was written to support a host and
	BlueCore01 on the same circuit board (in a cell phone).
	
	Later versions of the BCSP Link Establishment engine use an extension
	that allows the local engine to spot when the peer engine restarts -
	typically the case when the peer reboots.
	
	To use this feature both sides of the BCSP link must support this
	extension and the value of this variable must be non-zero. This
	variable sets the number of "conf" messages emitted by the local
	engine, as described in CSR document "BCSP Link Establishment 
	Protocol", CS-101681-SP, available from the CSR support website.

NAME
	PSKEY_HOSTIO_MAP_SCO_PCM (0x01ab)

SUMMARY
	Map SCO over PCM

TYPE
	bool

DEFAULT VALUE
	(FALSE)

DESCRIPTION
	The following options are available to route SCO data over PCM port:
	
	- Use the BCCMD command MAP_SCO_PCM to cause the next HCI 
	  Add_SCO_Connection command to route to a PCM port.
	      
	- Use this PSKey.
	
	- [unified-25 onwards] Use streams interface.
	
	If this PSKey is TRUE and PSKEY_HOSTIO_MAP_SCO_CODEC is FALSE
	then all attempts to open SCO connections map to one of the PCM ports 
	based on PSKEY_HOSTIO_MAP_SCO_PCM_SLOT.
	
	In HCI 14.X builds, only a single SCO stream can flow over the
	BlueCore2-EXT's PCM port.
	
	In HCI 15.X and later builds which do not have facility of 
	PSKEY_HOSTIO_MAP_SCO_PCM_SLOT, set the PSKey to cause all attempts
	to open SCO channels to run over *the first* PCM channel in the PCM
	port. (The clock settings in PSKEY_PCM_CONFIG32 determine whether
	the PCM port can carry more than one SCO channel.)
	
	See PSKEY_HOSTIO_MAP_SCO_PCM_SLOT, PSKEY_HOSTIO_MAP_SCO_CODEC.
	Also see the CSR document "BlueCore Audio API Specification",
	CS-209064-DD.
	
	Type bool is fundamentally a uint16 with values 0 and 1 mapping to

NAME
	PSKEY_HOSTIO_BREAK_POLL_PERIOD (0x01ad)

SUMMARY
	Break poll period (microseconds)

TYPE
	TIME

MINIMUM
	(0)

MAXIMUM
	(10 * SECOND)

DEFAULT VALUE
	(0)

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey sets the rate at which to poll the UART at start up to 
	determine if the host is sending a break (continuous 0) in 
	microseconds. Between polls the chip enters a low power state (deep 
	sleep). If the break signal is removed, normal operation resumes.
	
	Use this PSKey with PSKEY_HOSTIO_UART_RESET_TIMEOUT. This enables 
	the host to force the chip into a low power state using a limited 
	number of I/O lines.
	
	To place the chip in a low power state, the host sends a continuous
	break which forces a hardware reset if PSKEY_HOSTIO_UART_RESET_TIMEOUT
	is set. After resetting, if the break is still present, the chip
	enters a low power state, waking only at the rate defined by this
	key to check for the continuing presence of the break.
	
	A short delay (of a few hundred microseconds) occurs after the
	reset before the low power state is entered. This is due to the time
	required to initialise the PS and the support for deep sleep. 
	
	If this value is zero then the feature is disabled.
	
	This feature only works with the BCSP, H4 and H5 host transports.
	
	Type TIME is fundamentally a uint32.

SUMMARY
	Minimum SCO packet size sent to host over UART HCI

TYPE
	uint16

MINIMUM
	(1)

MAXIMUM
	(128)

DEFAULT VALUE
	(30)

DESCRIPTION
	A SCO link provides a steady flow of audio samples from air that
	have to be sent to the host. When SCO data is passed to the host
	over HCI (i.e., not over the chip's PCM port) the samples have to be
	formed into HCI SCO packets.
	
	This PSKey sets the minimum number of *samples* in each HCI SCO
	packet sent to the host over a UART transport - BCSP and H4. (USB
	has separate rules for defining SCO transport.)
	
	Set this to zero to minimise audio data latency. However this can
	crowd other data off the host transport. When the available host
	bandwidth is too low this can block all other traffic, so HCI ACL,
	HCI CMD/EVT, etc. stop flowing.

DESCRIPTION
	Some versions of BlueCore include an audio codec, typically used to
	drive an external microphone and earpiece.  
	
	If this PSKey is TRUE, and if PSKEY_HOSTIO_MAP_SCO_PCM is also TRUE,
	then all SCO connections are routed through the built-in audio codec
	rather than though the normal PCM interface.

NAME
	PSKEY_USE_OLD_BCSP_LE (0x01b4)

SUMMARY
	Use the old version of BCSP link establishment

TYPE
	uint16

DEFAULT VALUE
	FALSE

DESCRIPTION
	If this PS Key is set to FALSE then the firmware uses the BCSP Link
	Establishment protocol described in CSR document "BCSP Link
	Establishment Protocol", CS-101681-SP, otherwise it uses the older
	protocol described in CSR document bc01-s-010g.
	
	The new protocol was modified to provide a more robust behavior when 
	a host spontaneously reboots or restarts. The new behavior only 
	differs significantly from the old one in that:
	
	    - The "choke" is turned off when moving from "curious" to
	      "garrulous".
	
	    - The "cnf_cnt_limit" logic is removed; "conf" messages are
	      continuously emitted in the "curious" state.
	
	For detailed descriptions of the state machines and signals see CSR
	document "BCSP Link Establishment Protocol", CS-101681-SP.
	
	You may need to set this PSKey to TRUE if the host has an old 
	implementation of BCSP Link Establishment. Old implementations
	may not support the "garrulous" state.
	
	See PSKEY_BCSP_LM_CNF_CNT_LIMIT.

NAME
	PSKEY_PCM_FORMAT (0x01b6)

SUMMARY
	PCM data format

TYPE
	uint16

DEFAULT VALUE
	(0x006c)

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey sets the data format used to send SCO data over the PCM
	port. The format is the same as for HCI_Write_Voice_Setting. The
	bottom two bits of this key (air format) are always ignored and should
	be set to zero. The air format specified with HCI_Write_Voice_Setting
	is used instead.
	
	The Bluetooth HCI spec mandates that devices boot up with 16-bit
	linear data format. Unfortunately many PCM codecs do not expect this
	format so this PSKey allows the HCI format to be overridden so that
	manufacturers can set it correctly for the hardware and application
	designers do not need to know the correct format.
	
	If this PSKey is set to 0xffff then the format specified
	with HCI_Write_Voice_Settings is used and so the PCM format
	can be changed dynamically (this is almost never required).
	
	On BlueCore2 all PCM streams get the same format.
	
	On devices with an internal codec, if SCO data is routed to the
	internal codec then this PSKey is ignored and the correct value for
	the internal codec is used.

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey sets the audio output gain when using the built-in codec.
	
	The interpretation varies depending on the device.
	
	BlueCore2-External: 
	 Bits [2:0] set the gain (7 = maximum gain)
	
	BlueCore5-MM:
	 Bits [2:0] set the analogue gain (5 = unity gain)
	 Bits [7:4] set the digital gain (0 = unity gain)
	 Bit [10] enables an extra 3dB of gain on DAC_A
	 Bit [11] enables an extra 3dB of gain on DAC_B
	
	BlueCore7-MM:
	 Bits [2:0] set the analogue gain (7 = unity gain)
	 Bits [7:4] set the digital gain (0 = unity gain)
	
	On other devices with a codec:
	 Bits [2:0] set the analogue gain (5 = unity gain)
	 Bits [7:4] set the digital gain (0 = unity gain)
	 Bits [9:8] set the sigma-delta gain (0 = nominal)
	
	Important exception:
	 On BlueCore7-FM the codec ADC and DAC share the same analogue gain.
	 Therefore bits [2:0] also set the codec analogue input gain.

	 Bits   [7:4] set the digital gain (0 = unity gain)
	 Bit    [8]   enables the input pre-amplifier
	 Bits   [9:10] set the pre-amplifier gain (0 = unity gain)
	
	On other devices with a codec:
	 Bits   [3:0] set the analogue gain    (8 = optimum noise)
	 Bits   [7:4] set the digital gain     (0 = unity gain)
	 Bit      [8] enables scaling down of DAC outputs

	PSKEY_HOSTIO_SCO_PCM_THRESHOLDS (0x01bb)

SUMMARY
	Thresholds for SCO PCM buffers

TYPE
	uint16[2]

DEFAULT VALUE
	{8, 20}

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey sets the upper and lower thresholds for the buffers used to
	hold SCO data flowing between air and the PCM port.
	
	The thresholds are checked just before a packet is received from air
	and just after a packet is sent to air.
	
	If the data pending in the buffer exceeds the upper threshold when the
	level is checked, a sample is deleted from the buffer. If the pending
	data in the buffer drops below the lower threshold, a sample is
	inserted into the buffer.
	
	The thresholds are held as a uint16[2]. The first value gives the
	lower threshold and the second value gives the upper threshold.
	
	This PSKey has no effect on some versions of firmware.

NAME
	PSKEY_HOSTIO_SCO_HCI_THRESHOLDS (0x01bc)

SUMMARY
	Thresholds for SCO HCI buffers

TYPE
	uint16[2]

DEFAULT VALUE
	{10, 80}

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey sets the upper and lower thresholds for the buffers used 
	to hold SCO data flowing between air and the HCI.
	
	The thresholds are checked just before a packet is received from air
	and just after a packet is sent to air.
	
	When the thresholds are exceeded, the firmware inserts or delete
	single samples or groups of samples to bring the amount of data
	pending in the buffer into range. The exact behaviour depends on
	whether the SCO data is in transparent format and which host transport
	is in use.
	
	The thresholds are held as a uint16[2]. The first value gives the
	lower threshold and the second value gives the upper threshold.
	
	This PSKey has no effect on some versions of firmware.

SUMMARY
	Route SCO data to specified slot in pcm frame

TYPE
	uint16

MINIMUM
	(0)

MAXIMUM
	(7)

DEFAULT VALUE
	(0)

DESCRIPTION
	When PSKEY_HOSTIO_MAP_SCO_PCM is TRUE, the first SCO
	channel opened is routed over the chip's PCM port.  While this SCO
	channel is in place, all subsequent attempts to open extra SCO
	channels fail.
	
	The SCO channel is routed over the PCM timing frame slot defined by
	this PSKey. This PSKey's default value, zero, routes to "the first"
	PCM slot.
	
	The number of slots in the PCM port's timing frame depends on the
	value of PSKEY_PCM_CONFIG32. For example, there is no use in setting
	PSKEY_HOSTIO_MAP_SCO_PCM_SLOT to 3, asking for SCO data to travel
	over the 4th slot in the PCM frame if the PCM channel's clock rate
	only supports a single slot per frame.
	
	This PSKey is available only in builds for BlueCore2 and later
	chips. Functionality equivalent to this PSKey is available in
	BlueCore01b builds using a bit field in PSKEY_PCM_CONFIG, a PSKey
	absent from builds for BlueCore2 and later chips.
	
	The maximum value for this PSKey is now 7 for BlueCore7-FM, where the 
	upper 4 slots redirect the PCM out of interface 2.
	
	For all previous chips the maximum value is 3.

DESCRIPTION
	When the firmware sends a reliable message over BCSP or H5 it starts
	a timer. The timer's period is the value of this PSKey in
	milliseconds. If the host acknowledges reception of the message
	before the timer fires then the timer is cancelled. If the timer
	fires then the message is sent again and another timer started, etc.
	
	You can limit the number of times a timer is used for
	a given reliable BCSP/H5 message using PSKEY_UART_TX_MAX_ATTEMPTS.
	
	Note: The "H5" host transport protocol is properly known as the 
	"Three-Wire  UART Transport Layer", but is commonly known as H5 
	within CSR.
	
	For more information see CSR document "BlueCore Serial Protocol

DESCRIPTION
	The description of PSKEY_UART_ACK_TIMEOUT outlines BCSP's mechanism
	to retransmit reliable messages to the host until acknowledged.
	
	This PSKey sets a limit on the number of
	times the send/timeout cycle is attempted. If this limit is
	reached, the firmware panics and usually reboots.
	
	Messages are sent indefinitely if this PSKey is set to zero, i.e.,
	the value zero is treated as infinity.
	
	This PSKey is also used with H5.

MAXIMUM

DEFAULT VALUE
	(4)

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey holds the size of the sliding window used by BCSP.
	
	When the baseband sends a reliable BCSP message to the host then the
	host is required to acknowledge its reception. If it is not
	acknowledged within a certain period the message is sent again.
	
	The baseband sends several packets to the host before waiting for
	the first of the packets to be acknowledged. The maximum number of
	sent packets that can be unacknowledged at any time is set by this
	PSKey. When a packet is acknowledged, the next packet is sent.
	Under normal circumstances, the number of packets in transit to the
	peer is the value of PSKEY_UART_TX_WINDOW_SIZE.
	
	This PSKey is also used with H5.  
	
	Note: The "H5" host transport protocol is properly known as the

NAME
	PSKEY_UART_HOST_WAKE (0x01c7)

SUMMARY
	UART host wakeup

TYPE
	uint16[4]

DEFAULT VALUE
	{4, 		/* disable */ 
			500,            /* ms before host sleeps */ 
			10,             /* ms wakeup pulse needed */ 
			0}              /* ms pause before comms */

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey configures the use of a wakeup signal by the BlueCore to 
	wake the peer UART device from a low power state. The wakeup signal, 
	which may be either a UART break condition or a pulse on a PIO line, 
	is specified by PSKEY_UART_HOST_WAKE_SIGNAL. 
	
	If this PSKey's mechanism is turned on, the firmware judges when the
	peer may have entered its deep sleep state based on timers, and the
	local device can be set to emit a wakeup signal before sending data
	to the peer. Normally the length of the break condition is set to be
	sufficient to allow the peer to come fully awake as the local device
	normally sends a message to the peer afterwards.
	
	Most systems do not require the BlueCore to emit a wakeup signal to
	wake up the peer device. Systems using the BCSP transport, for
	example, support the host and baseband entering a deep sleep state,
	in which their UARTs are disabled. The devices may enter deep sleep
	when they choose, without warning that they are about to enter deep
	sleep and without signalling when they are in deep sleep. When one
	device wishes to send data to its peer it sends a message; the
	message can be lost (because the peer's UART may be turned off) but
	the presence of the message rouses the peer. For reliable BCSP
	channels the message is resent if it has not been acknowledged after
	a delay (set by PSKEY_UART_ACK_TIMEOUT), and the message normally
	gets through the second time, as the peer is then awake. This
	mechanism is adequate for most systems, but using a host
	wakeup signal may reduce delay implied by PSKEY_UART_ACK_TIMEOUT.
	
	This use of wakeup signals by the BlueCore is turned off by default,
	as this suits most systems.
	
	This PSKey has four uint16 parameters:
	
	    Enable: Values: 1 => enable mechanism
	                    4 => disable mechanism
	    Sleep_Delay: Milliseconds after tx to host or rx from host, after 
	                    which host is assumed to have gone into its
	                    deep sleep state. (Range 1 -> 65535.)
	                    When using BCSP or H5 host transports it is 
	                    recommended that this is greater than the
	                    acknowledge delay (set by PSKEY_UART_ACK_TIMEOUT).
	    Break_Length: Duration of wake signal in milliseconds.
	                    (Range 1 -> 1000.)
	    Pause_Length: Milliseconds between end of wake signal and
	                    sending data to the host. (Range 0 -> 1000.) 
	
	In builds from HCI 18.X, this key replaces
	PSKEY_UART_HOST_INITIAL_STATE, PSKEY_UART_HOST_ATTENTION_SPAN,
	PSKEY_UART_HOST_WAKEUP_TIME, and PSKEY_UART_HOST_WAKEUP_WAIT.

NAME
	PSKEY_UART_HOST_WAKE_SIGNAL (0x01ca)

SUMMARY
	Signal to use for uart host wakeup protocol

TYPE
	uint16

DEFAULT VALUE
	(0x0000)

DESCRIPTION
	BlueCore can be configured to output a wakeup signal to the host
	prior to sending it data if it considers that the host may be in a
	low power state. PSKEY_UART_HOST_WAKE enables this wakeup signalling
	and specifies the various timers required. 
	This PSKey specifies the wakeup signal to 
	use: a UART break signal, a pulse on a PIO line or, for the 
	H4DS transport only, a repeated byte sequence.
	
	This PSKey's value is split into two:
	  Bits [3:0] hold a value that specifies the Host Wake Mechanism.
	  Valid values are:
	                     0 - repeated byte sequence (only for H4DS)
	                     1 - positive pulse on PIO
	                     2 - negative pulse on PIO
	                     3 - UART BREAK condition
	
	  Bits [7:4] hold a value that specifies the PIO pin to be used if a
	  PIO pulse was specified as the Host Wake Mechanism.
	
	
	If the Host Wake Mechanism is 0x00, BlueCore sends a repeated
	byte sequence. The duration of the byte train is specified by
	PSKEY_H4DS_WAKE_DURATION. This mechanism is available for the H4DS
	transport only. The byte sequence has been chosen to work well with
	BlueCore's Baud rate detection capability.
	
	If 0x00 is chosen when the host transport is not H4DS a UART BREAK 
	condition is used.
	
	If the Host Wake Mechanism is 0x01 then a positive pulse is signalled
	on the PIO pin selected by Bits [7:4]. (Value 0x0 in Bits [7:4]
	selects PIO[0], value 0x01 selects PIO[1], etc.). The duration of the
	pulse is specified by PSKEY_H4DS_WAKE_DURATION for the H4DS transport
	and by PSKEY_UART_HOST_WAKE for all other host transports.
	
	If the Host Wake Mechanism is 0x02 then a negative pulse is signalled
	on the PIO pin selected by Bits [7:4]. The duration of the pulse is
	specified by PSKEY_H4DS_WAKE_DURATION for the H4DS transport, and by
	PSKEY_UART_HOST_WAKE for all other host transports.
	
	If the Host Wake Mechanism is 0x03 then a break condition is signalled
	by the UART. The duration of the break signal is specified by
	PSKEY_H4DS_WAKE_DURATION for the H4DS transport, and by
	PSKEY_UART_HOST_WAKE for all other host transports.

SUMMARY
	Bus-keeper/pull-disable for BCSP/H5 host transports

TYPE
	uint16

DEFAULT VALUE
	0x0000

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey configures the enhanced pull device control features
	present on some BlueCore chips for input lines associated with the
	BCSP and H5 host transports (i.e., the UART lines).
	
	The bits in this PSKey only come into effect if BCSP or H5 is selected
	as the host transport at boot time. The selected modes are enabled at
	boot time during BCSP/H5 initialisation and never disabled.
	
	Bit 0 controls "bus-keeper" mode. When an input is in "bus-keeper"
	mode, the polarity of the internal pull device follows that of the
	last externally driven input. (This mode has no effect on pins that
	are driven as outputs by the BlueCore.)
	If this bit is clear (the default), "bus-keeper" mode is never
	enabled; if set, "bus-keeper" mode is enabled at the appropriate time
	by the firmware.
	
	Bit 1 controls "pull-disable" mode. Normally, all inputs have a pull
	device with defined polarity (pull-up or pull-down); in
	"pull-disable" mode, the pull device is disabled entirely, leaving a
	true tri-state input.
	If this bit is clear (the default), the pull device is never
	disabled; if set, the pull device is disabled at the appropriate time
	by the firmware.
	
	Note: In general, if "pull-disable" mode is enabled, the
	"bus-keeper" bit has no effect.
	
	Note: Incorrect configuration of this key can lead to excessive power
	consumption and can potentially damage the chip. If a pull device is
	disabled, but the input is not driven externally (which includes not
	being physically connected, or even not being brought out on the chip
	package), that input floats, leading to excessive current flow.
	
	The default value of this PSKey is safe in this regard.
	"Bus-keeper" mode has no such concerns.

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey configures the enhanced pull device control features

	H4DS host transport (i.e., the UART lines). See
	PSKEY_BCSP_PULL_CONTROL for more information on the pull device
	control features.
	
	The bits in this PSKey only come into effect if H4DS is selected as
	the host transport at boot time. The selected modes are enabled at
	boot time during H4DS initialisation and never disabled.
	
	Bit 0 controls "bus-keeper" mode: if this bit is clear (the default),
	"bus-keeper" mode is never enabled; if set, "bus-keeper" mode is
	enabled at the appropriate time by the firmware.
	
	Bit 1 controls "pull-disable" mode: if this bit is clear (the

	PSKEY_PCM_PULL_CONTROL (0x01e2)

SUMMARY
	Bus-keeper/pull-disable for PCM bus(es)

TYPE

DEFAULT VALUE
	0x0011

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey configures the enhanced pull device control features
	present on some BlueCore chips for input lines associated with the
	PCM/I2S interface(s). See PSKEY_BCSP_PULL_CONTROL for more information
	on the pull device control features.
	
	The affected lines on each interface are PCM_IN, PCM_OUT, PCM_CLK,
	and PCM_SYNC. Because these can only be controlled as a group, any
	unused lines must be connected and driven appropriately if the pull
	control features are to be used.
	
	There are two complementary bits used to control each feature for
	each PCM interface. One controls the configuration while the
	interface is actively being used to transfer data, and another
	controls the configuration while it is inactive.
	
	The following bits in this PSKey take effect when a PCM interface is
	actively being used by the BlueCore to transfer data:
	
	Bit 0 controls "bus-keeper" mode on the first PCM bus: if this bit is
	clear, "bus-keeper" mode is not enabled during transfers; if set (the
	default), "bus-keeper" mode is enabled during transfers.
	
	Bit 1 controls "pull-disable" mode on the first PCM bus: if this bit
	is clear (the default), the pull device is not disabled during
	transfers; if set, the pull device is disabled during transfers.
	
	The following bits in this key take effect when a PCM interface is
	inactive, and not being used by the BlueCore to transfer data:
	
	Bit 2 controls "bus-keeper" mode on the first PCM bus: if this bit is
	clear (the default), "bus-keeper" mode is not enabled whilst the
	interface is inactive; if set, "bus-keeper" mode is enabled whilst
	the interface is inactive.
	
	Bit 3 controls "pull-disable" mode on the first PCM bus: if this bit
	is clear (the default), the pull device is not disabled whilst the
	interface is inactive; if set, the pull device is disabled whilst the
	interface is inactive.
	
	Bits [7:4] similarly control the second PCM bus, where present.
	
	For Unified-25 firmware and later, the following bits in this key take
	effect when a PCM interface is in the intermediate state:
	
	Bit 8 controls "bus-keeper-disable" mode on the first PCM bus: if this
	bit is clear (the default), "bus-keeper" mode is enabled when the bus
	is in the intermediate state; if set, "bus-keeper" mode is disabled
	when the bus is in the intermediate state.
	
	Bit 9 controls "pull-disable" mode on the first PCM bus: if this bit
	is clear (the default), the pull device is not disabled when the bus
	is in the intermediate state; if set, the pull device is disabled when
	the bus is in the intermediate state.
	
	Bits [13:12] similarly control the second PCM bus, where present.
	
	NOTE: Incorrect configuration of this key can lead to excessive power
	consumption and can potentially damage the chip. The default value is
	safe in this regard.

	PSKEY_UART_BITRATE (0x01ea)

SUMMARY
	UART baud rate in bits per second

TYPE
	uint32

DEFAULT VALUE
	(38400)

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey replaces PSKEY_UART_BAUDRATE for BlueCore7+ chips. 
	
	Setting this PSKey to zero has a special meaning: this triggers the 
	chip to automatically detect the baud rate. This is intended for ROM
	parts.
	
	If this key is non-zero at boot, then the UART is configured to 
	the rate specified by this PSKey in bits per second.

NAME
	PSKEY_USB_HOST_WAKE_ENABLE (0x01eb)

SUMMARY
	Enable USB host wakeup

TYPE
	uint16

DEFAULT VALUE
	(0x0004)        /* both functions disabled */

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey enables the host wakeup mechanism for USB. 
	If the USB host wakeup mechanism is turned on, the firmware judges
	when the peer may have entered its deep sleep state based on timers,
	and the local device can be set to emit a wakeup signal before sending
	data to the peer. Normally, the length of the host wake signal is set 
	to be sufficient to allow the peer to come fully awake because the 
	local device normally sends a message to the peer straight afterwards.
	
	This PSKey also enables another setting, Tx_Remains_Asleep.
	If this setting is enabled the chip assumes that the host remains
	asleep even when it has transmitted data. This means the chip 
	attempts to wake the host whenever it has data to transmit, regardless
	of whether the host transmitted recently or not. The only time it does
	not wake the host for a transmit is if it is transmitting for a second
	time within the host wake period, and so woke the host recently.
	
	This PSKey's value is a bitfield:
	        Bits [3:0]: Enable:       1: enable mechanism
	                                  4: disable mechanism
	        Bit 4: Tx_Remains_Asleep: 1: enabled
	                                  0: disabled
	
	BlueCore use of wakeup signals is disabled by default
	because this suits most systems.

                        0}       /* microseconds pause before comms */

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey configures BlueCore use of a wakeup signal to wake the peer
	USB device from a low power state. This wakeup mechanism is enabled 
	via PSKEY_USB_HOST_WAKE_ENABLE. The wakeup signal, which is a pulse 
	on a PIO line, is specified via a separate PSKey, 
	PSKEY_USB_HOST_WAKE_SIGNAL.
	
	This PS key has three uint32 parameters:
	   Sleep_Delay:         Microseconds after tx to host, or rx from 
	                        host after which the host is assumed  
	                        to have gone into its deep sleep state. 
	                        (Range 1 -> 4294967295)
	   HWake_Signal_Length: Minimum duration of wake signal in 
	                        microseconds.
	                        (Range 0 -> 1000000)
	   Pause_Length:        Microseconds between end of wake signal 
	                        and sending of data to the host. 
	                        (Range 0 -> 1000000) 
	
	The minimum HWake_Signal_Length that can actually be produced is 
	15us achieved by setting the value to 0us.

DESCRIPTION
	If the host wakeup mechanism for USB is enabled via 
	PSKEY_USB_HOST_WAKE_ENABLE, this PSKey can specify the
	wakeup signal to use: either a positive or negative pulse on a PIO
	line.
	
	This PSKey's value is a bitfield:
	        Bits [3:0]: Host Wake Mechanism. 1 => positive pulse on PIO
	                                         2 => negative pulse on PIO

ENUM_INCLUDE_FILE
	io_bt.h

ENUM_VALUES
	AS_SOON_AS_POSSIBLE   sets D+ at boot (<100ms)
	AFTER_CONFIGURATION   sets D+ when configuration is done (when ready)

DESCRIPTION
	By default, D+ pullup is activated during initialization as per the
	USB standard. If PSKEY_USB_DATA_PLUS_PULL_CONTROL is set to
	AFTER_CONFIGURATION ('sets D+ when configuration is done'), D+ pullup
	is only activated when configuration is complete.
	If PSKEY_USB_CHARGER_DETECTION_ENABLE is set to 'Voltage source
	detection' then the value of PSKEY_USB_DATA_PLUS_PULL_CONTROL is
	ignored and the firmware always acts as if 
	PSKEY_USB_DATA_PLUS_PULL_CONTROL has been set to AFTER_CONFIGURATION
	('sets D+ when configuration is done').

SUMMARY
	Watchdog timeout (microseconds)

TYPE
	TIME

MINIMUM
	(0)

MAXIMUM
	(60 * SECOND)

DEFAULT VALUE
	(5 * SECOND)

DESCRIPTION
	BlueCore has hardware support to run a watchdog timer. This is a
	timer that is set to the value of this PSKey every time it is
	"kicked" (written to by the firmware). If the firmware fails to
	kick the watchdog within this period the chip's watchdog hardware
	forces a hardware reset of the chip. This supports the
	possibility that the chip's firmware might crash or hang
	up.
	
	The value is in microseconds. If the value is zero the watchdog is
	disabled.
	
	This PSKey is used in conjunction with PSKEY_ENABLE_SOFT_WD to enable 
	the watchdog in its debug mode.
	See description of PSKEY_ENABLE_SOFT_WD.
	
	Also see the description of PSKEY_WD_PERIOD.
	
	Type TIME is fundamentally a uint32.  Value SECOND is 1000000.

	This PSKey sets the watchdog period, (nominally) the microseconds
	between kicking the watchdog hardware.
	
	This should be no more than 70% of PSKEY_WD_TIMEOUT (unless the
	timeout value is zero).

ENUM_VALUES
	phys_bus_none   No host to chip connection

	 phys_bus_usb   USB link
	  phys_bus_h4   UART link running H4

	  phys_bus_h5   UART link running H5
	phys_bus_h4ds   UART link running H4 with deep sleep
	phys_bus_sdio   SDIO or CSPI link

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey selects the physical connection that is used to pass 
	information to and from the host - BCSP, H4, USB, etc.  Only one of 
	these can be used at a time, mainly because the USB interface uses 
	some of the same chip pins as the UART.
	
	Much of the chip's support for BCSP/H5 is performed by hardware. This 
	allows interrupt routines to deal with complete BCSP/H5 packets.
	When the chip uses its UART in a more naive fashion, e.g., for H4,
	this support must be disabled. The UART's hardware support for
	BCSP/H5 must be enabled via PSKEY_UART_CONFIG_BCSP/H5.
	
	The H4 specification requires the use of UART hardware flow control
	and no use of parity. These must also be set via PSKEY_UART_CONFIG_H4.
	
	Type phys_bus is really a uint16. The PSKey takes values:
	
	        0: No chip to host connection
	        1: BCSP
	        2: H2 - USB
	        3: H4 - UART
	        4: VM access to the UART
	        6: H5
	        7: H4DS
	        9: SDIO
	
	Note: The "H5" host transport protocol is properly known as the 
	"Three-Wire  UART Transport Layer", but is commonly known as H5 
	within CSR.

NAME
	PSKEY_HQ_ACTIVE (0x01fc)

SUMMARY
	Enable Host Query Task

TYPE
	bool

DEFAULT VALUE
	(TRUE)

DESCRIPTION
	The device's HQ (host query) task can send messages to the host over
	either BCSP channel 3 or tunnelled through the CSR 
	manufacturer-specific HCI extensions. The channel's protocol has an 
	RPC-style structure. This means each message should cause the host to 
	send a corresponding response back to the chip. The protocol is 
	described in document "HQ Protocol", CS-102660-SP, available from the 
	CSR support website.
	
	If PSKEY_HQ_ACTIVE is set to TRUE (1), then the device's HQ task is
	enabled. If PSKEY_HQ_ACTIVE is set to FALSE (0), then the device's
	HQ task is configured so that no HQ traffic is sent to the host.
	
	See PSKEY_HQ_HOST_TIMEOUT.
	
	For more information see the CSR documents "HQ Protocol", CS-102660-SP

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_BCCMD_SECURITY_ACTIVE (0x01fd)

SUMMARY
	Enable configuration security

TYPE
	bool

DEFAULT VALUE
	(FALSE)

DESCRIPTION
	The firmware's bccmd task presents a command interpreter to the host
	in a manner similar to HCI. The command interpreter's command set is
	not part of any Bluetooth standard. It is specific to the BlueCore
	chips and firmware. The command set is used for monitoring and 
	controlling the chip, running radio tests, etc. The command set is 
	described in document "BCCMD Commands," CS-101482-SP.
	
	The command interpreter is accessed via the BCCMD protocol. The BCCMD
	protocol is described in document "BCCMD Protocol",
	CS-101676-SP. This can run over a BCSP channel (channel 2, see 
	document "BCSP Channel Allocation", CS-101680-SP), over a CSR 
	manufacturer-specific HCI extension channel or over the chip's SPI 
	interface.
	
	The bccmd task provides a simple access control mechanism for BCCMD
	commands presented over BCSP or HCI-extension; this mechanism is not
	present for SPI access.
	
	This PSKey enables the security mechanism. The security mechanism is
	described in the document "BCCMD Protocol Security", CS-101679-SP.
	
	When a BlueCore module is freshly manufactured this bool flag is set
	FALSE. The host may then read and write all PS values and can run
	all of the BCCMD commands. This allows the manufacturer to configure
	the Bluetooth module.
	
	When the configuration is complete the manufacturer sets this PSKey
	to TRUE. This enables the PS and BCCMD access controls. When set
	TRUE this PSKey cannot be set back to FALSE via BCSP running over the
	BCSP extension channel or the HCI extension channel. Setting security
	active is therefore normally a one-way operation.
	
	Type bool is fundamentally a uint16 with values 0 and 1 mapping to
	FALSE and TRUE.
	
	For more information see "BCCMD Protocol Security", CS-101679-SP, 
	"BCCMD Protocol", CS-101676-SP, "BCCMD Commands," CS-101482-SP and 
	"BCSP Channel Allocation", CS-101680-SP.

NAME
	PSKEY_ANA_FREQ (0x01fe)

SUMMARY
	Crystal frequency

TYPE
	uint16

DEFAULT VALUE
	(26000)

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey configures the BlueCore hardware to work with a particular 
	reference clock frequency.
	
	For chips prior to BlueCore2-ROM the default, 4, configures the chip
	to use a 16 MHz reference. The value defines a reference frequency
	of n*250 kHz where n is an integer, but there is a pseudo-random
	mapping from n to the required value. This is described in supporting
	documentation. 
	
	For BlueCore2-ROM and subsequent chips, the value defines the
	reference frequency in units of 1 kHz. The default value, 26000,
	configures the chip to use a 26 MHz reference. If the PSKey is absent
	or the value is zero, the chip attempts to pick a frequency;
	this cannot be relied on to be the correct frequency, so the radio
	is not usable.
	
	The automatic clock frequency detection mechanism is likely to be most
	useful in ROM parts, and is described in document "Booting BlueCore 
	ROM", CS-101436-ME, available from the CSR support website.
	
	When an external crystal is in use, it is usually necessary to make
	fine adjustments to allow for variations in individual crystals.
	See the description of PSKEY_ANA_FTRIM and PSKEY_ANA_FTRIM_OFFSET for
	details.

NAME
	PSKEY_PIO_PROTECT_MASK (0x0202)

SUMMARY
	Access to PIO0 - PIO15 pins

TYPE
	uint16

DEFAULT VALUE
	(0)

DESCRIPTION
	Each BlueCore chip contains a PIO port that may, under BCCMD or VM
	control, be used as a general I/O port. However, various
	optional hardware and software configurations require the use of
	certain PIO pins for their own needs. For example, an optional 
	external PA/LNA block may be driven using PIO pins 0 and 1.
	
	This PSKey prevents applications from changing PIO pins that are
	required for lower level functions. This blocking action applies
	to host-based applications requesting PIO changes via BCCMD and
	to VM applications running on the chip.
	
	Some of the lower level functions automatically prevent the
	application from changing the state of PIOs being used by the
	function by overriding the value of the relevant bits in this
	PSKey. This includes the PIOs related to PSKEY_TXRX_PIO_CONTROL,
	PSKEY_USB_PIO_VBUS, PSKEY_USB_PIO_DETACH, PSKEY_USB_PIO_PULLUP,
	PSKEY_USB_PIO_WAKEUP and PSKEY_USB_PIO_RESUME. So, for example
	if PSKEY_USB_PIO_DETACH claims the use of PIO[5] then this PIO
	cannot be changed by application code no matter what the value
	of PSKEY_PIO_PROTECT_MASK is.
	
	Bits [7:0] of this uint16 PSKey map to PIO0 to PIO7 respectively.
	If a bit of the PSKey's value is set high then application code
	cannot change the value of the corresponding PIO port pin.
	
	Note: On the current Casira motherboard, PIO2 is connected to USB+
	via a 1k5 resistor. The USB+ pin doubles as the UART RTS line on
	BlueCore, so care must be taken if an application uses PIO2.

	3   PIO drives tx+rx inverted, internal amp ramps power
	4   PIO drives tx+rx, internal amp ramps power, aux dac sets external amp gain
	5   PIO drives tx+rx, internal amp ramps power, aux dac sets external LNA

DESCRIPTION
	The chip contains a radio power amplifier (PA) and low noise
	amplifier (LNA), allowing it to act as a limited-range Bluetooth
	device. Although this is adequate for many applications, some
	systems require more range and so use external PA/LNA devices.
	
	If external devices are used, two pins of the PIO port are allocated
	to control them. On BlueCore7 onwards, the pins used are configurable
	by PSKEY_TXRX_PIO_TX and PSKEY_TXRX_PIO_RX. On earlier chips the LNA
	is enabled by pin PIO0 and the PA by pin PIO1.
	
	Before transmitting, the chip normally ramps up the power to the
	internal PA, then it ramps it down again afterwards.  However, if a
	suitable external PA is used it may be possible to ramp the power
	externally using the AUX_DAC pin.
	
	This PSKey sets the PA/LNA configuration:
	
	    0: The two PIO lines are not driven for Tx and Rx.  The chip's
	        internal PA/LNA is used.
	
	    1: The two PIO lines are driven high to enable the external PA
	        and LNA. Tx power ramping is controlled by the internal PA.
	
	    2: The two PIO lines are driven high to enable the external PA
	        and LNA. Tx power ramping is controlled on the external PA
	        via the chip's AUX_DAC pin.  The
	        "external_pa" entries in PSKEY_POWER_TABLE are used.
	
	    3: The two PIO lines are driven low to enable the external PA
	        and LNA. Tx power ramping is controlled by the internal PA.
	
	    4: PIO lines driven high for external PA and LNA;
	        Tx power ramping controlled by internal PA. External PA 
	        controlled (not ramped) by chip's AUX_DAC pin. The 
	        "external_pa" entries in PSKEY_POWER_TABLE are used.
	
	    5: PIO lines driven high for external PA and LNA;
	        Tx power ramping controlled by internal PA.  External LNA
	        gain controlled by chip's AUX_DAC pin. The AUX_DAC
	        is varied by the AGC between zero and its maximum in 16 steps.
	
	Hardware restrictions prevent the use of active low PIO pins and
	external PA ramping.
	
	The behaviour of the chip's AUX_DAC pin is undefined unless this key
	is set to 2 or 4.

DESCRIPTION
	Some Motorola codecs allow their gain to be controlled by 3 extra

	This PSKey sets the value of these three bits for SCO data sent from
	chip's PCM channels (channels 0-3 on PCM1 and PCM2, if exists). It 
	is expected that low values will map to high volume levels, though
	the firmware has no knowledge of this: it just passes the bits into
	the PCM stream. If this value is not needed then it may make sense
	to set this key to zero.
	
	It is possible that the firmware will acquire dynamically-settable
	attenuation controls for the PCM channel(s). In this case this
	PSKey will set the initial attenuation value.

NAME
	PSKEY_UART_SLEEP_TIMEOUT (0x0222)

SUMMARY
	Time in ms to deep sleep if nothing received

TYPE
	uint16

MINIMUM
	(0)

MAXIMUM
	(30 * 1000)

DEFAULT VALUE
	(1000)

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey applies when the host interface is BCSP, H5, H4DS or VM 
	access to the UART, and depends on the key PSKEY_DEEP_SLEEP_STATE
	being set to allow deep sleep.
	If there has been no transmission from the host for at least this 
	number of milliseconds, and there is no data to send, then the chip
	may go into deep sleep, depending on restrictions from any other
	source.
	Set the value to 0 to inhibit deep sleep for BCSP, H5, H4DS
	or VM UART access, but it has no effect if another host interface is
	in use.
	
	If using BCSP or H5, do not set this sleep timeout to a non-zero
	value that is less than or equal to either of the BlueCore's
	retransmit period (configured in PSKEY_UART_ACK_TIMEOUT) or the peer
	device's retransmit period.
	
	Note: The "H5" host transport protocol is properly known as the 
	"Three-Wire  UART Transport Layer", but is commonly known as H5 
	within CSR.
	
	Any data on the UART wakes the chip from deep sleep.
	However the particular transmission that wakes it is lost.
	The chip wakes up about 5ms later.

NAME
	PSKEY_DEEP_SLEEP_STATE (0x0229)

SUMMARY
	Deep sleep state usage

TYPE
	deep_sleep_state

DEFAULT VALUE
	(DEEP_SLEEP_ALWAYS_ACCURATE)

ENUM_INCLUDE_FILE
	io_bt.h

ENUM_VALUES
	          DEEP_SLEEP_NEVER   deep sleep will not be used
	         DEEP_SLEEP_ALWAYS   deep sleep used whenever possible
	       DEEP_SLEEP_INACTIVE   deep sleep may be used if no links
	DEEP_SLEEP_ALWAYS_ACCURATE   deep sleep whenever possible and assume slow clock is accurate

DESCRIPTION
	BlueCore has two types of low power state. "Deep sleep" allows
	most saving, and so has more constraints on its use. This PSKey 
	configures deep sleep.
	
	Type deep_sleep_state can be treated as a uint16, taking these
	values:
	
	    NEVER           (0): Deep sleep is never be used.
	    ALWAYS          (1): Deep sleep is used whenever possible.
	    INACTIVE        (2): Deep sleep when there are no ACL
	                         connections.
	    ALWAYS_ACCURATE (3): Deep sleep is used whenever possible;
	                         the firmware assumes the module has an
	                         accurate slow clock which does not
	                         need calibrating after startup.
	
	The ALWAYS_ACCURATE setting should be used when the slow clock
	source is stable enough to not require periodic re-calibrating.
	
	This setting saves power because the firmware does not need to
	calibrate the slow clock against the standard 20 ppm clock after
	the frequency of the slow clock has been determined at boot.
	
	Crystal-controlled slow clock sources should not require periodic
	re-calibration whereas use of the BlueCore's internal low power 
	slow speed clock requires periodic recalibration.
	
	From BlueCore7 some devices support the internal derivation of a
	slow clock from the fast accurate clock. If this option is used the
	fast clock continues to run (in a low power mode if used a quartz
	crystal) to support this function even when the device is in deep
	sleep.
	
	In this case the ALWAYS_ACCURATE option should be selected because
	slow clock frequency is stable.
	
	If the BlueCore in use does not support deep sleep timing derived
	from the fast clock then ALWAYS_ACCURATE should only be used when
	PSKEY_DEEP_SLEEP_USE_EXTERNAL_CLOCK is set to TRUE and a suitably
	stable external slow clock source is available.
	
	Deep sleep may be entered when an ACL connection is in hold, sniff
	or park mode; hence accuracy may be lost when using the internal
	low power slow speed clock.  In certain situations, where power
	saving is not a major priority but maintaining accuracy of the clock
	is (for example, a network access point which has a large number of
	parked connections), it may be advantageous to disable deep sleep
	mode with this key.
	
	Note that changing this PSKEY has implications for the setting of
	PSKEY_DEVICE_DRIFT. See the description of that key for details.
	
	Deep sleep also causes slightly slower response on the UART when
	BCSP is in use if no data has been received for a while.  See
	PSKEY_UART_SLEEP_TIMEOUT.
	
	This does not affect the other low power states, in which clock
	accuracy is not lost.

NAME
	PSKEY_HCI_HANDLE_FREEZE_PERIOD (0x0237)

SUMMARY
	Time for which HCI handle is frozen after link removal

TYPE
	TIME

DEFAULT VALUE
	(15 * SECOND)

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey holds the default period in microseconds for which data 
	reception on a HCI connection handle is maintained after the 
	corresponding connection has been removed.
	
	Reception must be enabled for this additional period as stray late
	data may come from the host. The freeze period should therefore be
	sufficiently large for the host to realise that a HCI connection has
	been removed or has failed.
	
	Any data received during the period when the connection handle is
	frozen is diverted into a dummy buffer and so effectively
	discarded.
	
	Any data received after this period may result in either a chip
	panic PANIC_HOSTIO_MISPLACED_DATA (when the transport is BCSP, H5,
	SDIO or USB) or a fault FAULT_H4_RX_BAD_PDU for most H4-based
	transports. Alternatively when the transport is BCSP or H5 a
	PANIC_HOSTIO_DATA_IN_BUFFER_ERROR may be seen and when the transport
	is USB a PANIC_USB_HW_FATAL_ERROR may be seen. On firmware builds from
	the 24 branch onwards, some H4 transports may
	PANIC_HOSTIO_MISPLACED_DATA or PANIC_HOSTIO_DATA_IN_BUFFER_ERROR
	rather than FAULT_H4_RX_BAD_PDU.
	
	The value stored by this PSKey is also the minimum time before an HCI
	connection handle can be re-allocated for a new connection.
	
	Maintaining a connection handle for this additional period consumes
	some of the chip's resources. Therefore creating and destroying
	connections rapidly relative to the freeze period results in a
	resource leak. After the number of currently frozen handles reaches
	a limit set by PSKEY_MAX_FROZEN_HCI_HANDLES, further attempts to
	create connections are rejected.
	
	Type TIME is fundamentally a uint32.  Value SECOND is 1000000.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_MAX_FROZEN_HCI_HANDLES (0x0238)

SUMMARY
	Maximum number of frozen HCI handles

TYPE
	uint16

DEFAULT VALUE
	(20)

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey holds the default number of frozen connection handles at 
	which further connection requests are refused.
	
	After a connection has been removed, its HCI handle is maintained
	active for a short period, defined by PSKEY_HCI_HANDLE_FREEZE_PERIOD.
	Some resources are required to maintain the link active and so if
	connections are created and destroyed rapidly in relation to this
	period, resources are gradually consumed.
	
	To prevent constraining the operation of any existing connections due
	to lack of memory, further connection requests are rejected when
	the number of currently frozen handles reaches the value stored under
	this PSKey.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_PAGETABLE_DESTRUCTION_DELAY (0x0239)

SUMMARY
	Delay from freezing buf handle to deleting page table

TYPE
	TIME

DEFAULT VALUE
	(50*MILLISECOND)

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKey sets the default delay in microseconds from the point at 
	which a buffer is redirected until its page table and any MMU memory 
	allocated to it can be freed.
	
	Buffers used to receive data from the host are redirected to point to
	a dummy buffer when a connection is torn down. This enables reception
	to continue on this buffer (connection) handle for a certain period
	after a link is removed.
	
	Most of the buffer resources can be freed as soon as the handle is
	redirected. The buffer page table address however is cached by the
	CSR chip hardware during the reception of an HCI data packet payload.
	The page table therefore cannot be destroyed for a period equal to the
	duration of the largest packet that the host can send.
	
	Type TIME is fundamentally a uint32.  Value SECOND is 1000000.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_IQ_TRIM_PIO_SETTINGS (0x023a)

SUMMARY
	IQ PIO settings

TYPE
	uint8

MINIMUM
	(0)

MAXIMUM
	(15)

DEFAULT VALUE
	(6)

DESCRIPTION
	
	This PSKEY defines the state of external TX & RX amp enable PIOs
	(defined in PSKEY_TXRX_PIO_TX & PSKEY_TXRX_PIO_RX) during
	automatic IQ calibration. This PSKEY is valid for pre-BlueCore 5
	(which uses lower 4 bits of uint8) & BlueCore 7 chips (which uses
	lower 3 bits of uint8).
	
	For pre-BlueCore 5 & BlueCore 7 chips if Bit 2 is set to 1 it 
	enables TX & RX amp enable PIOs to be set to a particular state 
	during IQ trim. In this case, the state of TX & RX amp enable PIOs
	is set by the PSKey's bits 1 and 0 respectively.  If Bit 2 is set
	to 0 then the existing values of the PIO lines will be preserved 
	through the IQ trim and bits 0 and 1 of the PSKey are ignored.  For 
	pre-BlueCore 5 If PSKey Bit 3 is set to 1 then the external transmit
	power control DAC is enabled at its maximum setting during IQ trim.
	
	During the auto-IQ trim both transmitter and receiver are active.
	Energy from the transmitter is looped back to the receiver which is
	used to measure the level of image rejection which has been
	achieved.  For this to work successfully the transmitter must be
	presented with a respectable load.
	
	For Class 1 modules the transmitter drives a PA.  The impedance
	presented to the transmitter is generally respectable even if the PA
	is not switched on during the auto-IQ trim.
	
	For modules with no PA the transmitter output is coupled via a
	balun to the transmit/receive switch.  The impedance presented to the
	transmitter during auto-IQ trim is dependent on the setting of the
	transmit/receive switch, which is governed by external TX & RX amp
	enable PIOs. However different switch models exhibit different
	behaviour with the PIO control lines, even switch models from
	the same manufacturer. For example, it is possible for the
	switch to present a high impedance, ground or even a time varying
	impedance to the transmitter.
	
	For modules with a PA, external TX & RX amp enable PIOs should be 0 
	to ensure that the PA is disabled during auto-IQ trim (although 
	certain modules invert these PIO lines, requiring different 
	settings).
	
	For modules with no PA the PSKey should be set to place the
	transmit/receive switch in the state that provides optimum
	performance for the auto-IQ trim algorithm.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_DEEP_SLEEP_WAKE_CTS (0x023c)

SUMMARY
	Exit deep sleep on CTS line activity

TYPE
	uint16

MAXIMUM
	(2)

DEFAULT VALUE
	(0)

DESCRIPTION
	Deep sleep is allowed with some (but not all) host interfaces that use
	the UART. This key determines whether the chip will wake from deep
	sleep due to activity on the CTS line from the host, and also due to
	activity on the data RX line. Three values are allowed.
	
	    0: The chip wakes due to activity on the data RX line,
	       but does not wake due to activity on the CTS line. This is
	       the default.
	    1: The chip wakes due to activity on either the data RX line
	       or the CTS line.
	    2: The chip wakes due to activity on the CTS line, but does
	       not wake due to activity on the data RX line.
	
	Note that the chip is sensitive to the level on both lines: if the
	line is held low, and wake-up on the line has been enabled, the chip
	will be kept out of deep sleep. Note also that the chip is sensitive
	to the lines themselves; it is not actually required that there is a
	host using the UART for data communication.
	
	If the host interface is set to `none', i.e. the firmware has been
	informed that no host communication is in use, it is still possible to
	use the CTS line to wake the chip. However the data RX line is
	ignored. This is because this line is floating in many hardware
	configurations with no host interface.
	
	The key is ignored if the host interface is USB. 

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_FC_HC2H_FLUSH_DELAY (0x023d)

SUMMARY
	Delay from disconnect to flushing HC->H FC tokens

TYPE
	TIME

DEFAULT VALUE
	(10 * SECOND)

DESCRIPTION
	The default delay in microseconds from destroying a connection until
	any outstanding host controller to host flow control tokens are
	flushed.
	
	This delay is required to workaround a race hazard in the hci
	specification.  The host might not acknowledge packets sent around
	the time when it is sent a disconnect event - the buffers used for
	these packets should thus be assumed to be free by the host
	controller.  However as the processing of the disconnect is not
	synchronised on the host and host controller, a delay is required to
	ensure the host has actually flushed its buffers and thus prevent
	temporary overruns.
	
	The time delay from disconnection to flushing the buffers should be
	less than the time for which a connection handle is frozen after
	disconnection (defined by PSKEY_HCI_HANDLE_FREEZE_PERIOD).  This
	ensures the handle is not re-allocated during the flush delay and
	thus that the buffers for the new link are not interfered with.
	
	(Type TIME is fundamentally a uint32.  Value SECOND is 1000000.)

NAME
	PSKEY_RX_HIGHSIDE (0x023e)

SUMMARY
	Disable the HIGHSIDE bit in ANA_CONFIG

TYPE
	bool

DEFAULT VALUE
	(FALSE)

DESCRIPTION
	If this key is FALSE, the local oscillator frequency is 1.5 MHz less
	than the carrier frequency to be received, whereas if it is TRUE the
	LO frequency is 1.5 MHz higher than the carrier frequency.
	
	For chips starting with BlueCore2-ROM and versions of firmware
	starting with 17.4, this is taken as an input to the algorithm which
	calculates the RF frequency parameters for each receive channel.  The
	result may be that some channels do not use the value of this key.
	
	(Type bool is fundamentally a uint16 with values 0 and 1 mapping to
	FALSE and TRUE.)

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_CLOCK_REQUEST_ENABLE (0x0246)

SUMMARY
	External clock request enable

TYPE
	uint16

DEFAULT VALUE
	(0)

DESCRIPTION
	The BlueCore can be configured to use a PIO to indicate that it
	requires an external high-speed clock reference at the frequency
	configured by PSKEY_ANA_FREQ. This line will be inactive when no
	clock reference is required (for instance, when the BlueCore is in
	deep sleep).
	
	If set to 0, no PIO is used as a clock request.
	
	If set to 1, PIO[6] is active when an external clock reference is
	required, and is inactive otherwise.
	
	If set to 2, PIO[2] is active when an external clock reference is
	required, and is inactive otherwise.
	
	If set to 3, PIO[2] is active when an external clock reference is
	required or if PIO[3] is high, and is inactive when a clock
	reference is not required and PIO[3] is low.
	
	Values of 2 and 3 are only useful for versions of the BlueCore
	hardware starting with BlueCore2-ROM.
	
	In the default configuration, a PIO is held high when active and
	held low when inactive.  In versions of BlueCore from BlueCore3-ROM,
	this behaviour can be altered by setting
	PSKEY_CLOCK_REQUEST_FEATURES.

	29,30,31,61,62,63.  This can be used to improve C/I performance and
	to improve consistency of receiver sensitivity over frequency range.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_HOST_INTERFACE_PIO_USB (0x0250)

SUMMARY
	USB host interface selection PIO line

TYPE
	uint16

DEFAULT VALUE
	<none>

DESCRIPTION
	The PIO line used for forcing the host interface to be USB. The
	absence of this key, or the value 0xFFFF, indicates that this feature
	is not in use.
	
	The interface to the host is normally set by PSKEY_HOST_INTERFACE.  
	If this key is set then the specified PIO line is checked at boot
	time, and if it is asserted (high) then the host interface is set to
	USB, overriding the setting of PSKEY_HOST_INTERFACE.
	
	The other host transport related persistent store keys must be set
	appropriately for both the default (probably BCSP) and USB transports.
	
	If PSKEY_HOST_INTERFACE_PIO_H4 is also valid, and both PIO lines are
	asserted (or they are the same line), this key takes precedence.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_DEEP_SLEEP_CLEAR_RTS (0x0252)

SUMMARY
	Deep sleep clears the UART RTS line

TYPE
	bool

DEFAULT VALUE
	(FALSE)

DESCRIPTION
	This key is used for deep sleep with the BCSP and H5 host transports
	only. If TRUE, the chip clears the RTS line (i.e. sets it high) when
	it enters deep sleep, and (depending on the state of the UART) may
	reset it afterwards if it is ready to receive.
	
	If hardware flow control is in effect on the remote host, setting the
	key causes the remote UART not to transmit packets while the chip is
	in deep sleep. Therefore it is not possible to use the effect of BCSP
	retransmissions to wake the chip. Usually, therefore, this key will be
	used in combination with PSKEY_DEEP_SLEEP_WAKE_CTS.
	
	(Type bool is fundamentally a uint16 with values 0 and 1 mapping to
	FALSE and TRUE.)

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_DEEP_SLEEP_PIO_WAKE (0x0255)

SUMMARY
	PIO line to wake the chip from deep sleep

TYPE
	uint16

MAXIMUM
	(16)

DEFAULT VALUE
	(16)

DESCRIPTION
	The number of a PIO line, 0 to 15, which will cause the chip to wake
	from deep sleep.  This use does not preclude the use of the same PIO
	line as an ordinary input.  However, a PIO which is usually configured
	as an output may not be used.  If the setting is out of range, no PIO
	line will be used.  The wake-up is triggered by the level of the line
	being held high for at least 1 millisecond, not by the rising or
	falling edge.
	
	If the chip notices it has been woken, and it is configured to use the
	UART, it will remain out of deep sleep for at least the period given
	by PSKEY_UART_SLEEP_TIMEOUT.  This is because it cannot distinguish
	wakeups from the two sources.  Otherwise, the chip may return to deep
	sleep as soon as there is no task to be performed.
	
	If the VM is configured to use a PIO line as an interrupt source, the
	chip will automatically be woken from deep sleep on that line, so this
	key is not usually required.  It may still be used; however, the chip
	may generate interrupts on the PIO line set by this key, since it does
	not discriminate between individual PIO lines.

	PSKEY_USR0 (0x028a)

SUMMARY
	User configuration data  0

TYPE
	uint16[]

DEFAULT VALUE
	<none>

DESCRIPTION
	Keys PSKEY_USR0 to PSKEY_USR49 are for use by host and on-chip
	application- specific code to allocate as it chooses.
	
	PSKEY_USR0 to PSKEY_USR24 may only be changed by DFU by placing
	them in the application protected section of the file and signing
	them with the application private key. These PS Keys are never
	included in DFU files uploaded from a BlueCore. This makes them
	suitable for storing module specific or sensitive information;
	use keys in the range PSKEY_USR25 to PSKEY_USR49 if such
	protection is not required.

	  USB_PULLUP_PIO_11   Use PIO 11
	USB_PULLUP_INTERNAL   Use internal pullup
	    USB_PULLUP_NONE   No pullup

DESCRIPTION
	This PS key sets the PIO line used to control the pull-up resistor on 
	the USB D+ line. The absence of this key in the persistent storage 
	indicates that this feature is not in use.
	
	This value is only used if the chip is presenting its USB interface.
	See the description of PSKEY_HOST_INTERFACE.
	
	On BlueCore, there are 16 PIO lines, 0 to 15 (depending on package
	type), but 12 to 15 are not available for the USB pullup.
	
	Alternatively an internal pullup can be used by setting this key to
	the value 'Use internal pullup', which is also the default value.
	
	If value 'No pullup' is selected then the firmware will not apply
	a pullup, in this case it is intended that the pullup will be
	controlled by a VM application.

	 USB_VBUS_PIO_14   Use PIO 14
	 USB_VBUS_PIO_15   Use PIO 15
	USB_VBUS_VDD_CHG   Use VDD_CHG (battery charger)

DESCRIPTION
	This PS key sets the PIO line used for USB VBus detection. Any of the 
	first 16 PIOs (numbered 0-15) may be used. In addition, for Bluecore
	variants with the relevant battery charger hardware, VDD_CHG can be
	selected instead of a PIO line.
	The absence of this key indicates that this feature is not in use.
	
	If specifying a PIO, the PIO line should be attached to the USB VBus
	line. BlueCore then uses the level of this PIO to implement USB
	attach (when VBus goes high) and detach (when VBus goes low) in the
	firmware.
	If specifying VDD_CHG, the VDD_CHG pin will already be connected
	to USB VBus, and this avoids having to tie up a PIO pin. VDD_CHG can
	still be used if PSKEY_CHARGER_DISABLE is set to TRUE.
	
	This key is only used if the chip is presenting its USB interface.
	See the description of PSKEY_HOST_INTERFACE. 
	
	This key can only be set to use a PIO above 7 in BlueCore firmware
	versions 23f and greater.
	
	This key can only be set to use VDD_CHG for Bluecore variants with the
	relevant battery charger hardware in BlueCore firmware versions 24 
	and greater.

NAME
	PSKEY_USB_PIO_WAKE_TIMEOUT (0x02d2)

SUMMARY
	Timeout for assertion of USB PIO wake signal

TYPE
	uint16

MINIMUM
	(0)

MAXIMUM
	(7)

DEFAULT VALUE
	(0)

DESCRIPTION
	The number of seconds for which the PIO wake signal will be asserted
	following the generation of data that is to be transmitted to the
	host when the BlueCore is in the USB detached state. 
	The timeout is reset each time new data is generated.
	
	If this value is 0, the signal is asserted indefinitely (or until the
	host de-asserts detach).
	
	This key is useful for hosts that are sometimes unable to respond to
	the wake signal (e.g. laptops when their lids are closed). If wake is
	asserted when the host cannot process wake and kept asserted until it
	is able to process the signal, then the host could be woken up to
	receive an event which is out of date. The host will, of course, have
	to process any old events when it does reconnect to a device following
	a wake timeout.
	
	This value is only used if the chip is presenting its USB interface.
	See the description of PSKEY_HOST_INTERFACE. 

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_USB_PIO_RESUME (0x02d3)

SUMMARY
	PIO signal used in place of bus resume

TYPE
	uint16

MINIMUM
	(0)

MAXIMUM
	(15)

DEFAULT VALUE
	<none>

DESCRIPTION
	The PIO line used to signal that the USB host wakeup from suspend.
	Any of the first 16 PIOs (numbered 0-15) may be used. The absence of
	this key indicates that this feature is not in use.
	
	PIO resume is used in place of the bus resume signal for hosts that
	are unable to respond to the bus signal during suspend e.g. PDAs that
	power-down the root hub in suspend. 
	
	The PIO line is high to indicate that the host should resume, low
	otherwise. It remains asserted until activity is restored on the USB.
	
	Setting this PS key is sufficient to enable this feature; no notice is
	taken of the remote wakeup setting of PSKEY_USB_ATTRIBUTES nor of
	whether the host has enabled remote wakeup.
	
	PSKEY_USB_PIO_RESUME is mutually exclusive with PSKEY_USB_PIO_WAKEUP -
	both can be enabled simultaneously and assigned to the same PIO pin.
	
	This value is only used if the chip is presenting its USB interface.
	See the description of PSKEY_HOST_INTERFACE. 
	
	This key can only be set to a value above 7 in BlueCore firmware
	versions 23f and greater.

NAME
	PSKEY_USB_BT_SCO_IF_CLASS_CODES (0x02d4)

SUMMARY
	USB Bluetooth SCO interface class codes

TYPE
	usbclass

DEFAULT VALUE
	{ 0xe0, 0x01, 0x01 }

DESCRIPTION
	Three bytes giving the class information for the USB "Interface
	Descriptor" (as defined in Table 9.9 of version 1.1 of the USB
	specification and in Table 9.12 (section 9.6.5) of version 2.0
	of the USB specification) which contains the SCO endpoints.
	
	This PS key enables different class codes to be used for the BT SCO
	interface from the main BT interface (which contains the control,
	event and acl endpoints and whose class codes are given by
	PSKEY_USB_BT_IF_CLASS_CODES). The advantage of this is that the host
	OS can load different drivers to communicate with each of the
	interfaces. This is expected to be of use for Microsoft's XP OS in
	which the in-built BT USB driver will not give access to the SCO
	endpoints.
	
	Type usbclass is held as a uint16[3]. The three values are held in the
	lower byte of each of the array in the order:
	
	        { class, subclass, protocol }.
	
	Default value maps to:
	    { WIRELESS_CONTROLLER, RF_CONTROLLER, BLUETOOTH_PROGRAMMING }.
	
	This value is only used if the chip is presenting its USB interface.
	See the description of PSKEY_HOST_INTERFACE.

NAME
	PSKEY_USB_SUSPEND_PIO_LEVEL (0x02d5)

SUMMARY
	USB PIO levels to set when suspended

TYPE
	uint16

DEFAULT VALUE
	(0)

DESCRIPTION
	This description covers PSKEY_USB_SUSPEND_PIO_LEVEL,
	PSKEY_USB_SUSPEND_PIO_DIR, PSKEY_USB_SUSPEND_PIO_MASK,
	PSKEY_USB_SUSPEND_PIO_NO_WAKE.
	
	To ensure that the limit on power drawn in suspend mode for a
	bus-powered device is met, BlueCore usually sets all PIO lines to low.
	However, this may not always be correct and this set of PS keys allows
	the configuration to be set.
	
	PSKEY_USB_SUSPEND_PIO_MASK indicates which PIOs should be set when in
	suspend mode. A 1 in the mask indicates a PIO line to be set according
	to the corresponding bits in PSKEY_USB_SUSPEND_PIO_LEVEL and
	PSKEY_USB_SUSPEND_PIO_DIR; a 0 indicates a PIO line that will be left
	alone.
	
	For each bit that is set to 1 in PSKEY_SUB_SUSPEND_PIO_MASK, a 0 (1)
	for the corresponding bit in PSKEY_USB_SUSPEND_PIO_LEVEL indicates
	that the line should be set low (high), and a 0 (1) for the
	corresponding bit in PSKEY_USB_SUSPEND_PIO_DIR indicates that the line
	will be set for input (output). Note that from BlueCore2 on if a line
	is set for input the level is still useful: it determines whether a
	weak pull-up or pull-down will be applied. Therefore for BlueCore1,
	PSKEY_USB_SUSPEND_PIO_DIR is not used and any line to be driven is set
	for output.
	
	Any PIO line configured via PSKEY_USB_PIO_PULLUP is handled
	separately; the bit does not need to be set in any of these three
	PSKEYs. The keys apply to a bus-powered USB device only; on a
	self-powered USB device the PIO lines are not modified in suspend
	mode.
	
	PSKEY_USB_SUSPEND_PIO_NO_WAKE (see description) provides a mechanism
	to disable PIO wakeup events during USB suspend.
	
	The names of these keys are misleading as the same
	facilities are used to handle BCCMDVARID_WARM_HALT and
	BCCMDVARID_COLD_HALT, regardless of the host transport.

NAME
	PSKEY_USB_STRING_DESCRIPTORS_MAP (0x02da)

SUMMARY
	USB string descriptors map

TYPE
	uint16[]

DEFAULT VALUE
	<none>

DESCRIPTION
	This key maps USB string descriptor indexes to the PSKEY numbers
	containing the string descriptors for those indexes.
	String descriptors are described in section 9.6.7 of the USB2.0
	specification.
	
	Each uint16 pair maps a string index to a PSKEY number. The format
	of this key is therefore:
	
	 {string_index, pskey_number}, {string_index, pskey_number}, ...
	
	If string descriptor index 8 is to be mapped to the string contained
	in PSKEY_USB_STRING_DESCRIPTOR0 (assume it's PSKEY number is 0x02db)
	and string descriptor index 6 is to be mapped to the string contained
	in PSKEY_USB_STRING_DESCRIPTOR15 (assume it's PSKEY number is 0x02ea),
	then PSKEY_USB_STRING_DESCRIPTORS_MAP would be set as follows:
	
	{8, 02db} , {6, 02ea}
	
	The PSKEY_USB_STRING_DESCRIPTORn keys were created to provide a
	convenient set of keys in which to store USB string descriptor
	strings.
	
	Only string descriptor index in the range 5..255 can be used as 1..4
	are reserved.

SUMMARY
	IQ subsequent calibration period in test

TYPE
	TIME

MINIMUM
	(0)

MAXIMUM
	(300 * SECOND)

DEFAULT VALUE
	(0)

DESCRIPTION
	In normal operation, the chip schedules regular trims of the IQ block
	to prevent degradation of the radio performance.  These are placed so
	as to avoid interfering with normal radio traffic.  This is not
	possible in radiotest mode when the transmissions are back to back,
	hence this key exists to choose the most suitable behaviour.
	
	Once the first IQ trim auto calibration is done in test mode, then
	subsequent trims are done at regular intervals with the period being
	given by this key, which is a time in microseconds.  If the value is 0
	then no subsequent trim is performed.
	
	If PSKEY_RADIOTEST_FIRST_TRIM_TIME is 0 then no trims are done during
	the test regardless of the setting of this key.

NAME
	PSKEY_FORCE_16MHZ_REF_PIO (0x03e1)

SUMMARY
	PIO line to force 16 MHz reference to be assumed

TYPE
	uint16

MINIMUM
	(0)

DEFAULT VALUE
	<none>

DESCRIPTION
	The number of a PIO line, 0 to 15, which will cause the value of
	PSKEY_ANA_FREQ to be ignored and a 16 MHz reference to be assumed
	instead.  A value of 0xFFFF, or absence of a value, indicates the
	feature is not to be used.
	
	This is useful in ROM builds which may set the PSKEY_ANA_FREQ default
	for a non-16 MHz reference (eg. 13 or 26 MHz, as commonly used in GSM
	phones). It allows correct operation with modules that use a 16 MHz
	crystal instead. Without this facility it would not be possible to
	make a host connection at a standard UART baud rate or with USB for
	modules that use a 16 MHz crystal.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_CLOCK_STARTUP_DELAY (0x03dd)

SUMMARY
	Clock startup delay in milliseconds

TYPE
	uint16

MAXIMUM
	(31)

DEFAULT VALUE
	(0)

DESCRIPTION
	On waking from deep sleep, BlueCore expects an accurate external clock
	supplied to the chip to be stable to 20 ppm within, by default, 5
	milliseconds. For configurations that use the clock request line (see
	PSKEY_CLOCK_REQUEST_ENABLE), this is measured from the clock request
	line being asserted. If this is not the case this PSKEY needs to be
	changed to an appropriate value.
	
	This PSKEY provides a time value in nominal milliseconds, from 1 to 31
	inclusive. BlueCore will wait for this time for the clock to
	stabilise. The special value zero (the default) is identical to using
	a value of 5, and causes a delay of 5 milliseconds to be used. Setting
	a value larger than that required for the clock to become stable will
	result in slightly less efficient power consumption on entry to and
	exit from deep sleep. Setting a value that is too small will result in
	erratic behaviour.
	
	On builds that support it, PSKEY_CLOCK_STARTUP_DELAY_FINE_ADJUSTMENT
	may be further used to add fine granularity to the wake up delay. To
	allow for very short delays, if the fine adjustment is non-zero,
	setting PSKEY_CLOCK_STARTUP_DELAY to zero no longer gives a 5 ms
	delay: see the description of
	PSKEY_CLOCK_STARTUP_DELAY_FINE_ADJUSTMENT for details.
	
	Note: on the BlueCore2-ROM this key has no effect if the value is less
	than 6 milliseconds, or if no clock request line is in use.

NAME
	PSKEY_DEEP_SLEEP_CORRECTION_FACTOR (0x03dc)

SUMMARY
	Deep sleep clock correction factor

TYPE
	int16

DEFAULT VALUE
	(0)

DESCRIPTION
	In deep sleep, BlueCore has a low power oscillator circuit which is 
	used to keep time. Different variants of the chip have slightly 
	different behaviour. This key allows the correction for the chip to
	be tweaked:
	lower (signed) values make the clock run slower, and higher values 
	make it run faster. This should only need to be changed for different
	hardware; therefore, the value should only be altered on advice from 
	CSR.
	
	The value is not applied if PSKEY_DEEP_SLEEP_USE_EXTERNAL_CLOCK is
	TRUE as the external slow clock will not have the same systematic 
	behaviour.

	temperature_calibration[]

DEFAULT VALUE
	{ { -40, -6}, 
                          {  20,  0} }

DESCRIPTION
	The value consists of a table of pairs of 16-bit signed values, as
	many pairs as necessary.  Each pair is in a similar format to
	PSKEY_TEMPERATURE_CALIBRATION: the first value is a temperature in
	degrees Celsius, while in this case the second is a signed correction
	to be made to the internal PA setting at that temperature.  The value
	will be interpolated linearly between those settings, but will not be
	extrapolated beyond the end of the temperature range.  The
	temperatures should increase monotonically, but the corrections at
	each temperature need not.

DESCRIPTION
	The value is a table in the same format as
	PSKEY_TEMPERATURE_VS_DELTA_INTERNAL_PA.  The values of the table
	(even-numbered 16-bit words) in this case are an adjustment applied to
	PSKEY_TX_PRE_LVL which should be in the range -15 to 15.  The
	adjusted value will be limited to the range 0 to 15.

DESCRIPTION
	The value is a table in the same format as
	PSKEY_TEMPERATURE_VS_DELTA_INTERNAL_PA.  The values of the table
	(even-numbered 16-bit words) in this case are an adjustment applied
	separately to both the top nybbles of PSKEY_TX_FILTER_CONFIG; hence
	they must lie in the range -15 to 15.  The adjusted nybbles will be

	For BlueCore5 and below
	It consists of four four-bit fields.  Bits 0 to 3 control the
	behaviour at resonance, bits 4 to 7 one channel away, bits 8 to 11 two
	channels away, and bits 12 to 15 three channels away.

NAME
	PSKEY_RSSI_CORRECTION (0x03c5)

SUMMARY
	RSSI correction factor.

TYPE
	int8

DEFAULT VALUE
	(0)

DESCRIPTION
	The BlueCore (from BlueCore2-Ext chip version onwards) is able to
	measure the signal strength of packets received from air. This
	measurement is of the signal strength at the input to the chip rather
	than at the input to the module i.e. it does account for any
	attenuation or gain provided by external components such as the
	antenna or a LNA.
	
	This PSKey specifies a value in dB that will be added to the
	BlueCore's RSSI reading to correct for external components.
	
	In builds prior to 19, this PSKey only affects the RSSI values
	reported in 'inquiry response with RSSI' HCI events; it does not
	affect the RSSI value reported via the HCI_Read_RSSI command. In
	19 builds and upwards, this key affects all RSSI values reported
	by the chip.

NAME
	PSKEY_DEEP_SLEEP_USE_EXTERNAL_CLOCK (0x03c3)

SUMMARY
	Deep sleep uses external 32 kHz clock source

TYPE
	bool

DEFAULT VALUE
	(FALSE)

DESCRIPTION
	Versions of BlueCore from BlueCore3 can take a 32 kHz clock input to
	act as a timing source when the chip is in deep sleep.  (This is
	referred to as the slow clock.)  Its frequency must be stable to at
	least 250 parts per million, and it must be continuously present
	while the BlueCore is powered.  Its use is enabled by setting this
	key to TRUE.
	
	The source of this clock varies:
	 - On BlueCore4 and prior, the clock input must be presented on AIO0;
	 - On BlueCore5-FM and BlueCore6-ROM, the clock input can be
	   presented either on a dedicated SLEEP_CLK pin (the default), or on
	   AIO0; selection is via PSKEY_DEEP_SLEEP_EXTERNAL_CLOCK_SOURCE;
	 - On BlueCore7-FM the clock input must be presented on the
	   dedicated SLEEP_CLK pin.
	 - Some parts after BlueCore7-FM have no dedicated SLEEP_CLK pin but
	   use one of a small selection of PIOs for the clock input, see
	   PSKEY_DEEP_SLEEP_EXTERNAL_CLOCK_SOURCE_PIO
	
	The clock does not have to be exactly 32 kHz; anything within a few
	percent (including 30 kHz) is useful.  The firmware will calibrate
	this external slow clock against the standard 20 ppm clock (as
	supplied by crystal or TCXO) at startup.  If PSKEY_DEEP_SLEEP_STATE
	is set to DEEP_SLEEP_ALWAYS_ACCURATE, the firmware will assume the
	external slow clock does not need subsequent calibration, saving
	extra power.
	
	If the worst-case accuracy of the supplied clock is significantly
	better than 250 parts per million, PSKEY_DEVICE_DRIFT can usefully be
	set to that accuracy.  This allows a slave in low power mode to turn
	on its radio for less time when attempting to resynchronise with its
	master. The worse-case accuracy of the supplied clock should not be
	any worse than 250 ppm for compliance with the Bluetooth
	specification.
	
	On devices which use the external 32 kHz clock for purposes other
	than timing deep sleep -- for instance, for the FM radio(s) on
	BlueCore5-FM and BlueCore7-FM -- this key must be set to enable
	calibration of the clock which is required for those uses. (If an
	external 32 kHz clock is present for such uses, it is almost
	certainly desirable to use it for sleep timing as well.)
	
	(Type bool is fundamentally a uint16 with values 0 and 1 mapping to
	FALSE and TRUE.)

	application, this key must be set to TRUE to ensure that the 
	firmware does not attempt to register the default HCI descriptors.

NAME
	PSKEY_I2C_CONFIG (0x03be)

SUMMARY
	I2C configuration

TYPE
	uint16

MINIMUM
	0x0000

MAXIMUM
	0x0001

DEFAULT VALUE
	0x0000

DESCRIPTION
	Configures the I2C bus.  The default value of this PSKey configures
	the I2C bus for maximally-portable use, i.e. standard mode with long
	timeouts, suitable for slow I2C EEPROMs.
	
	If Bit 0 is set, the I2C bus is configured for fast mode.  All other
	devices on the bus (i.e. all slave devices) must obey the fast mode
	I2C specification.  Note that in this mode the firmware does not have
	timeouts for SCL stretching -- the firmware will block while SCL is
	held low by the slave.
	
	Also note that fast mode is currently not implemented for signalling
	I2C operations such as (re)starts, stops and read acknowledgements;
	these will be performed as if in standard mode.

NAME
	PSKEY_USB_DONT_RESET_BOOTMODE_ON_HOST_RESET (0x03b9)

SUMMARY

DEFAULT VALUE
	0

DESCRIPTION
	If a USB reset is received after a device has been enumerated and the
	Bluecore is in a bootmode other than the default, the USB subsystem
	will force a reset into the default bootmode unless this key is set to
	TRUE.

NAME
	PSKEY_LC_USE_THROTTLING (0x03b8)

SUMMARY
	Adjust packet selection on packet error rate

DESCRIPTION
	Allow the LC to select the packet type it chooses depending on the
	packet error rate. Setting this to FALSE makes the LC select packet
	size on data size only.

NAME
	PSKEY_CLOCK_REQUEST_FEATURES (0x03b6)

SUMMARY
	Clock request is tristated if enabled

TYPE
	uint16

DEFAULT VALUE
	(0)

DESCRIPTION
	This key is only applicable if the value of PSKEY_CLOCK_REQUEST_ENABLE
	is non-zero.
	
	The clock request PIO can be configured to be active high or active
	low.  In an inactive state, it can be tristated or driven as an output
	by BlueCore.
	
	Bit 0 of this PSKEY inverts the polarity of the PIO when not
	tristated.
	 When it is set, the PIO is active low.
	 When it is clear, the PIO is active high.
	
	When Bit 1 is set, PIO is tristated when the clock request is
	inactive.  When Bit 1 is clear, PIO is a driven output when the clock
	request is inactive.
	
	The default behaviour is that the PIO is active high and always
	driven.
	
	The key is available from BlueCore3-ROM, but has no effect on 
	BlueCore3-Multimedia. BlueCore3-Multimedia has the clock request 
	line but this cannot be configured to either be inverted or tristated.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_INITIAL_PIO_STATE (0x03b5)

SUMMARY
	Initial state of PIO0 - PIO15 pins

TYPE
	uint16[2..6]

DEFAULT VALUE
	<none>

DESCRIPTION
	This key may be used to set the initial state of the PIO0-15 pins
	prior to the VM application running.  The key is an array of uint16s
	which can be considered to have the following structure:-
	
	 struct {
	   uint16 mask;
	   uint16 direction;
	   uint16 level;
	   uint16 bias;
	   uint16 buskeep_en;
	   uint16 disable_pull;
	 }
	
	Each word within the structure can be considered to be an array of
	bits corresponding to individual PIO pins.
	
	The mask word is used to control which PIO pins are controlled by this
	key.  Note that PIOs which are assigned to firmware functions
	(including those masked by PSKEY_PIO_PROTECT_MASK) are also masked
	out.
	
	The direction word is used to control pin direction:-
	 0 = input
	 1 = output 
	
	The level word is optional and controls pin output levels:-
	 0 = low 
	 1 = high
	
	From BlueCore2-External on, for pins set as inputs by the direction
	word, the corresponding bits in this word determine the direction of
	a weak pull device (0=pull-down, 1=pull-up).
	If the word is not present, pins will be set to their default power-on
	levels.
	
	The bias word is optional and controls the strength of the bias
	applied to pins configured as input:-
	 0 = weak bias
	 1 = strong bias
	
	If the word is not present, pins will be set to their default power-on
	bias strength. 
	
	The buskeep_en word is optional and controls whether "bus-keeper"
	functionality (see PSKEY_BCSP_PULL_CONTROL) is enabled for pins
	configured as inputs, on chips which support this:-
	 0 = bus-keeper disabled
	 1 = bus-keeper enabled
	
	If the word is not present, no bus-keepers will be enabled.
	
	The disable_pull word is optional and controls whether the internal
	pull device is disabled (see PSKEY_BCSP_PULL_CONTROL) for pins
	configured as inputs, on chips which support this. (These bits have
	no effect on pins configured as outputs.)
	 0 = pull device enabled
	 1 = pull device disabled
	
	If the word is not present, pull devices will be enabled.
	NOTE: disabling pull devices when pins are not driven externally can
	lead to excessive current consumption and potentially damage the
	chip.
	
	Example
	-------
	
	To set PIO 3 as an output driving a high signal and PIO 5 as an input
	with strong-bias set the key to (0x0028,0x0008,0x0008,0x0020). 
	
	 mask      = 0x0028    # (1<<5 | 1<<3) 
	 direction = 0x0008    # (1<<3) 
	 level     = 0x0008    # (1<<3)
	 bias      = 0x0020    # (1<<5)

NAME
	PSKEY_TX_AVOID_PA_CLASS1_PIO (0x03b3)

SUMMARY
	PIO line asserted in class1 operation to avoid PA

TYPE
	uint16

DEFAULT VALUE
	(0xFFFF)

DESCRIPTION
	This PS key is only used for class 1 operation, i.e. when
	PSKEY_LC_ENHANCED_POWER_TABLE has entries with the class 1 bit set.
	If no entry in the table is set for class 1 operation, the value of
	this PS key is ignored.
	
	The value gives a PIO line which will be asserted during a
	transmission when the external power amplifier is not in use.  The
	value 1 is not allowed, as it is always used to activate the external
	PA.  Any other PIO line may be used.  If the value is 0, it indicates
	that PIO 0 will be used for this purpose, in addition to any use
	specified by PSKEY_TXRX_PIO_CONTROL during receive operations.
	
	A value greater than 15 indicates that no PIO will be asserted when
	the external PA is not in use.
	
	Note that the PIO line is asserted by software, so does not have the
	accuracy of the hardware used for the external PA.  However, the
	PIO is guaranteed to be asserted at least while the radio is in use
	for transmission.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_MR_PIO_CONFIG (0x03b2)

SUMMARY
	PIO line asserted in class1 operation to avoid PA

TYPE
	uint16

DEFAULT VALUE
	(0)

DESCRIPTION
	Additional configuration for PIO lines used for hardware from
	BlueCore4 which supports Enhanced Data Rate (EDR).  Each bit
	specifies a different feature.
	
	Currently only Bit 0 is defined.  If it is set, any use of PIO 1 for
	activating an external power amplifier (as configured by
	PSKEY_TXRX_PIO_CONTROL) is tied to the enhanced data rate packet
	transmission: the PIO line goes high when the modulation scheme
	switches to EDR's Phase Shift Keying (PSK).  If it is clear, the
	default behaviour obtains: the PIO goes high when the packet header
	starts.  This bit is mostly useful for test purposes.

DESCRIPTION
	Configuration for UART rx sampling point in case there are any
	problems with fast (just below 4Mbps) UARTs.
	
	Currently 2 bits are defined.  Bit 0 is prefetch, Bit 1 is RX offset.
	The default value is 2, ie RX offset enabled, prefetch disabled.

DESCRIPTION
	Table in the same form as PSKEY_TEMPERATURE_VS_DELTA_INTERNAL_PA used

	temperature_calibration[]

DEFAULT VALUE
	{ { -40, 15}, 
                          {  20,  0} }

DESCRIPTION
	The value is a table in the same format as
	PSKEY_TEMPERATURE_VS_DELTA_INTERNAL_PA.  The values of the table
	(even-numbered 16-bit words) in this case are an adjustment applied
	separately to both the top nybbles of PSKEY_TX_FILTER_CONFIG when
	transmitting the header of a packet at Enhanced Data Rate; hence they
	must lie in the range -15 to 15.  The adjusted nybbles will be limited
	to the range 0 to 15.
	
	Note that, using the default values, there is a discontinuity in
	the values in this key at 55 deg C (pre-BlueCore5) or -20 deg C,
	which corresponds to switching off
	the TX IF attenuator (see PSKEY_MR_TX_IF_ATTEN_OFF_TEMP). Since
	BlueCore can only measure temperatures at a resolution of 1 deg C,
	this is represented by two consecutive values at 54 and 55 deg C or
	-21 and -20 deg C.
	
	(The abbreviation MR for Medium Rate is used consistently in place of
	EDR for Enhanced Data Rate throughout the PS keys as many were
	introduced before the abbreviation EDR came into use.)

DESCRIPTION
	Controls the state for each PIO line (0 to 15) that will wake 
	the chip from deep sleep. Each bit corresponds to a PIO line.
	Setting a bit high will result in the chip waking when that 
	line goes high, setting the bit low will cause the chip to 
	wake when the line goes low. The PIO lines must already have 
	been configured to wake the chip using either 
	PSKEY_DEEP_SLEEP_PIO_WAKE or the VM.

SUMMARY
	Set the charger current

TYPE

DEFAULT VALUE
	(0x0)

DESCRIPTION
	Certain devices from BlueCore4-Headset onwards allow a range of
	charger currents to be used. The actual current depends on the
	device type and the charge state of the battery. This key sets
	the default fast charge current to use, which is dependent on 
	the size and type of battery. The setting to use can be 
	determined from the battery and BlueCore device datasheets.
	
	On BlueCore7 and later devices, the key specifies the approximate
	charger current in mA. On earlier devices, the value range is 0-15
	and values greater than 15 are not supported. Consult the datasheet 
	for your BlueCore device for more detailed information.

TYPE
	uint32

DEFAULT VALUE
	(524288)

DESCRIPTION
	Default frequency (in 1/16 Hz) assumed for external 32kHz slow clock.
	This frequency is assumed if calibration fails, or is turned off
	(by setting PSKEY_EXTERNAL_SLOW_CLOCK_CALIBRATION_ATTEMPTS to 0).

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_SLOW_CLOCK_TEMP_HYSTERESIS (0x21d8)

SUMMARY
	Slow clock recal temperature hysteresis

TYPE
	uint16

DEFAULT VALUE
	(4)

DESCRIPTION
	The internal low power oscillator (known as the "slow clock") is
	recalibrated against the accurate clock when the temperature changes.
	If the temperature change since the last calibration exceeds the value
	of this key, another calibration is performed.
	
	The units of this key are degrees Celsius.
	
	Recalibration may be made more sensitive to temperature
	if the value of PSKEY_SLOW_CLOCK_TEMP_HYSTERESIS_MIN is lower than
	the value of this key.  If a large change in calibration (greater
	than 200 ppm) is detected, the required temperature change is reduced
	by steps of 1 degree Celsius until
	PSKEY_SLOW_CLOCK_TEMP_HYSTERESIS_MIN
	is reached.  If a small change in calibration (less than 100 ppm) is
	detected, the required temperature change is increased in steps of 1
	degree Celsius until PSKEY_SLOW_CLOCK_TEMP_HYSTERESIS is reached.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_PANIC_ON_FAULT (0x21ce)

SUMMARY
	Panic on encountering fault

TYPE
	bool

DEFAULT VALUE
	(FALSE)

DESCRIPTION
	When this key is FALSE (as it is by default), when a fault condition
	is encountered, BlueCore issues a fault report and carries on running.
	When this key is set to TRUE, BlueCore will instead panic immediately
	when any fault condition is encountered, with panic code
	PANIC_ON_FAULT (0x4E).
	
	This is intended as a diagnostic aid for CSR engineers. It should not
	be enabled except on advice from CSR, and CSR does not recommend
	setting it in production applications.
	
	Panics and faults are described in the document "HQ Commands",
	bcore-sp-003P.
	
	(Type bool is fundamentally a uint16 with values 0 and 1 mapping to
	FALSE and TRUE.)

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_PIO_DEEP_SLEEP_EITHER_LEVEL (0x21bd)

SUMMARY
	PIO deep sleep on either level

TYPE
	uint32

MINIMUM
	(0)

MAXIMUM
	(0xFFFFFFFF)

DEFAULT VALUE
	(0)

DESCRIPTION
	Allows the chip to deep sleep irrespective of the level of the PIO 
	lines. Traditionally BlueCore chips will stay out of deep sleep when 
	any PIO line configured as an input is high. This behaviour can be 
	modified by setting PSKEY_PIO_WAKEUP_STATE so that the chip will 
	stay out of deep sleep when lines are low, but enter deep sleep when 
	the lines are high. 
	
	Each bit in this PSKEY corresponds to a PIO line from 0 to 31. 
	Note that 31 PIOs may not be present on all BlueCores.
	Setting a bit will result that PIO's level having no effect on 
	the chip's deep sleep behaviour; the chip will go into deep
	sleep if the PIO is high or low. The BlueCore will still wakeup 
	to process changes in PIO levels.
	
	The PIO lines must already have been configured to wake the chip 
	using either PSKEY_DEEP_SLEEP_PIO_WAKE or the VM. 

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_PIO_WAKEUP_STATE2 (0x21ba)

SUMMARY
	PIO deep sleep wake up state 

TYPE
	uint16

MINIMUM
	(0)

MAXIMUM
	(0xFFFF)

DEFAULT VALUE
	(0xFFFF)

DESCRIPTION
	Controls the state for each PIO line (16 to 31) that will wake 
	the chip from deep sleep. Each bit corresponds to a PIO line.
	Setting a bit high will result in the chip waking when that 
	line goes high, setting the bit low will cause the chip to 
	wake when the line goes low.
	
	Note that not all chips have more than 16 PIOs, and some that
	do may not have a full 32.
	The PIO lines must already have been configured to wake the
	chip using the VM.

DESCRIPTION
	When this key is enabled, code loaded onto the DSP is given read and
	write access through data window 3. This key is only useful if your
	hardware design includes an external memory device which is accessed
	from the DSP.
	
	Note that to address an external memory device above 32Mbit in the
	BlueCore5mm address map, the application will also need to set
	MISC_EXT_RAM_EN or MISC_EXT_RAM_EN2 in PSKEY_GBL_MISC_ENABLES to
	enable PIO2 or PIO6 respectively as an additional address line. The
	application will also need to ensure that PIO line is an output, using
	PioSetDir from the VM application.
	
	Also note that if either of MISC_EXT_RAM_EN or and MISC_EXT_RAM_EN2 is
	set in PSKEY_GBL_MISC_ENABLES then the use of PSKEY_SRAM_PIO is 
	rendered useless and the effect would be same as if invalid Sram PIO
	value has been set in PSKEY_SRAM_PIO i.e., VM application gets failure
	(NULL return) if attempt is made to use SramMap trap.

DESCRIPTION
	This value must be set to enable temperature compensation. It is used
	to calibrate the internal thermometer and can be set separately for
	each individual chip.  It consists of three words.
	
	The first word is the calibration temperature in degrees Celsius

	This key is used on BlueCore7 onwards in place of
	PSKEY_TEMPERATURE_CALIBRATION, which was used up to and including
	BlueCore6. All three readings must be made together.
	
	The second and third values are the vref (4) and bandgap_vbe 
	(consult documentation for the correct selector) values as 
	returned from the standard BCCMD adc_read interface.
	
	To turn temperature compensation off, all words should be set to
	zero.  (Note that this must be *three* zero 16-bit words, as zero
	is an acceptable value for the temperature in degrees Celsius.)

NAME
	PSKEY_USB_CHARGER_DETECTION_ENABLE (0x2180)

SUMMARY
	Enables detection of dedicated USB chargers

TYPE
	uint16

DEFAULT VALUE
	(USB_CHARGER_DETECTION_OFF)

ENUM_INCLUDE_FILE
	io_bt.h

ENUM_VALUES
	           USB_CHARGER_DETECTION_OFF   No charger detection
	     USB_CHARGER_DETECTION_RESISTIVE   Resistive detection
	USB_CHARGER_DETECTION_VOLTAGE_SOURCE   Voltage source detection

DESCRIPTION
	This key determines whether the firmware will implement
	USB charger detection. (Note that this refers to detecting
	what is at the other end of the USB cable when the device
	is plugged in, not to be confused with the battery charger
	hardware on the Bluecore device itself).
	
	If set to 'No charger detection (0)' the firmware will not
	implement any charger detection. This is the default.
	
	If set to 'Resistive detection (1)' the firmware will use the
	Resistive Detection Mechanism (see the USB Battery Charging
	Specification Revision 1.0 section 3.10). This enables the firmware
	to distinguish between a dedicated charger and a standard host or hub.
	Note that this detection mechanism has been dropped from the USB 
	Battery Charging Specification Revision 1.2, in order to remain in
	conformance use Voltage source detection if available.
	
	If set to 'Voltage source detection (2)' the firmware will use the
	full charger detection procedure as detailed in the USB Battery
	Charging Specification Revision 1.1 section 3.2. This enables the
	firmware to distinguish between a standard host or hub, a dedicated
	charger, and a host or hub charger. This option is only available if
	the Bluecore device has the necessary hardware (see individual device
	data sheet). When this option is selected, the firmware will ignore
	the value of PSKEY_USB_DATA_PLUS_PULL_CONTROL and always act as if
	PSKEY_USB_DATA_PLUS_PULL_CONTROL has been set to AFTER_CONFIGURATION
	('sets D+ when configuration is done').
	
	A VM app can use trap UsbAttachedStatus() to find out to what it is
	currently attached.

DESCRIPTION
	This key configures the enhanced pull device control features present
	on some BlueCore chips for the clock request input. See
	PSKEY_BCSP_PULL_CONTROL for more information on the pull device
	control features.
	
	The bits in this key only have any effect when a clock request
	is in use, as determined by PSKEY_CLOCK_REQUEST_ENABLE. The
	selected modes are enabled at boot time and never disabled.
	
	Bit 0 controls "bus-keeper" mode: if this bit is clear (the default),
	"bus-keeper" mode is never enabled; if set, "bus-keeper" mode is
	enabled at the appropriate time by the firmware.
	
	Bit 1 controls "pull-disable" mode: if this bit is clear (the
	default), the pull device is never disabled; if set, the pull device
	is disabled at the appropriate time by the firmware.
	
	NOTE: incorrect configuration of this key can lead to excessive power
	consumption and can potentially damage the chip. The default value is
	safe in this regard.

NAME
	PSKEY_PMALLOC_BASE (0x2162)

SUMMARY
	Base pmalloc sizes array

TYPE
	uint16[]

DEFAULT VALUE
	
DEFAULT_POOLS_BASE

DESCRIPTION
	The pmalloc pool memory manager is used throughout the firmware and by
	VM applications. It is described briefly here, and in more detail in
	the application note CS-128085-AN "Configuring the BlueCore memory
	allocator".
	
	The way in which its raw RAM block is fragmented is
	specified by PSKEYS:
	 * PSKEY_PMALLOC_BASE
	 * PSKEY_PMALLOC_PER_ACL
	 * PSKEY_PMALLOC_PER_SCO
	 * PSKEY_PMALLOC_APP (when the firmware supports VM applications)
	 * PSKEY_PMALLOC_EXTRA
	
	Each of these keys is an array of pairs of uint16s: {uint16 el_size,
	uint16 n_elements}.  Each pair describes a pool containing n_elements
	each of size el_size (in 16-bit words).
	
	In the case of PSKEY_PMALLOC_PER_ACL, the key specifies the pools used
	by a single ACL link. The n_elements value for each pool in this key
	is multiplied by PSKEY_MAX_ACLS when carving up the raw RAM block.
	Similarly, the PSKEY_PMALLOC_PER_SCO key is multiplied by
	PSKEY_MAX_SCOS.
	
	PSKEY_PMALLOC_BASE, PSKEY_PMALLOC_PER_ACL, PSKEY_PMALLOC_PER_SCO and
	PSKEY_PMALLOC_EXTRA are calculated at firmware build time, and should
	not be modified except on specific advice from CSR.
	
	PSKEY_PMALLOC_APP has no default value. Customers may add a value
	which uses some or all of the storage specified in
	PSKEY_PMALLOC_EXTRA, but usually in a different configuration
	(typically to produce a few, large pools). Similarly, by reducing
	PSKEY_MAX_ACLS or PSKEY_MAX_SCOS, the storage used by an instance of
	PSKEY_PMALLOC_PER_ACL or PSKEY_PMALLOC_PER_SCO may be added to
	PSKEY_PMALLOC_APP. Hence, it is intended that users will alter
	PSKEY_PMALLOC_APP and possibly PSKEY_MAX_ACLS and PSKEY_MAX_SCOS if
	they require larger pools for their VM applications.
	
	The application note CS-128085-AN "Configuring the BlueCore memory
	allocator" describes the process of setting PSKEY_PMALLOC_APP in more
	detail. Customers should refer to this app note before altering the
	PSKEY_PMALLOC_APP key.
	
	Note that the pools specified by a given PSKEY are not reserved for
	a particular use by the firmware: they join a common set of pools
	available from the allocator. Hence it is possible for a pool
	specified by PSKEY_PMALLOC_APP to be taken by the firmware itself if
	no other pools are available.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_PMALLOC_PER_ACL (0x2161)

SUMMARY
	Per ACL pmalloc sizes array

TYPE
	uint16[]

DEFAULT VALUE
	
DEFAULT_POOLS_PER_ACL

DESCRIPTION
	This key specifies the memory pools used by a single ACL link. The
	format of the key is the same as that of PSKEY_PMALLOC_BASE.
	
	This key should not be altered except on specific advice from CSR.
	
	Reducing PSKEY_MAX_ACLS allows the memory claimed by an ACL link to
	be put to other uses (for example, use by VM applications). See the
	description of PSKEY_PMALLOC_BASE for more details.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_PMALLOC_PER_SCO (0x2160)

SUMMARY
	Per SCO pmalloc sizes array

TYPE
	uint16[]

DEFAULT VALUE
	
DEFAULT_POOLS_PER_SCO

DESCRIPTION
	This key specifies the memory pools used by a single SCO link. The
	format of the key is the same as that of PSKEY_PMALLOC_BASE.
	
	This key should not be altered except on specific advice from CSR.
	
	Reducing PSKEY_MAX_SCOS allows the memory claimed by a SCO link to
	be put to other uses (for example, use by VM applications). See the
	description of PSKEY_PMALLOC_BASE for more details.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_PMALLOC_APP (0x215f)

SUMMARY
	VM application pmalloc sizes array

TYPE
	uint16[]

DEFAULT VALUE
	<none>

DESCRIPTION
	This key specifies the memory pools created for use by the VM. It is
	only used in firmware which contains a VM. The format of the key is
	the same as that of PSKEY_PMALLOC_BASE.
	
	Altering this key allows users to create pmalloc blocks for use by the
	VM. Typically, these blocks will be larger than those which the
	firmware provides by default. As the total size of the memory
	available to the pmalloc allocator is fixed, altering this key may
	involve altering PSKEY_MAX_ACLS or PSKEY_MAX_SCOS to claim back some
	memory. See the description of PSKEY_PMALLOC_BASE for details.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_PMALLOC_EXTRA (0x215e)

SUMMARY
	Extra pmalloc sizes array

	This key specifies memory pools which are not regarded as essential
	for operation of the firmware. The format of the key is the same as
	that of PSKEY_PMALLOC_BASE.
	
	This key should not be altered except on specific advice from CSR.
	
	See the description of PSKEY_PMALLOC_BASE for details of the memory
	allocator.

NAME
	PSKEY_LC_GOLDEN_RANGE_MIN (0x22c3)

SUMMARY
	Lower limit of the Bluetooth receiver golden range

TYPE
	int8

MINIMUM
	(-80)

MAXIMUM
	(-56)

DEFAULT VALUE
	(-60)

DESCRIPTION
	This key controls the position of the lower limit of the Bluetooth
	receiver golden range. The upper limit is always 20 dB above the lower
	limit. This key is in units of dBm.
	
	The golden range has two uses.
	
	Firstly it's used in power control. If the signal being received from
	the remote device is above the upper limit of the golden range then
	BlueCore will signal the remote device to decrease its transmit
	power. If the signal is below the lower limit then BlueCore will
	signal the remote device to increase its transmit power.
	
	Secondly it's used in the response to the HCI command Read_RSSI. If
	the received signal strength is above the top of the golden range the
	HCI command response is a positive number indicating how many decibels
	the signal was above the top. If the received signal strength is below
	the bottom of the golden range then the response is a negative number
	indicating how many decibels the signal is below the bottom. If the
	received signal is inside the golden range then the response is 0.
	
	It is recommended that the value of this key not be changed from its
	default value of -60 dBm.
	
	If you find your device has a golden range significantly different
	from the number given by this key then you may need to correct the
	RSSI calibration for the path loss of your module design. This is done
	by adjusting PSKEY_RSSI_CORRECTION.
	
	Older firmware, depending on which chip it was targetting used either
	the keys PSKEY_LC_RSSI_GOLDEN_RANGE and
	PSKEY_PREFERRED_MIN_ATTENUATION or the key PSKEY_RSSI_PREFERRED_VALUES
	to determine the position of the golden range.

NAME
	PSKEY_BLE_MAX_LINKS (0x22c2)

SUMMARY
	Maximum BLE links

TYPE
	uint16

MINIMUM
	(0)

MAXIMUM
	(40)

DEFAULT VALUE
	(5)

DESCRIPTION
	The maximum number of concurrent BLE links to other devices.
	
	The RAM used to maintain the connection state for a BLE link is
	shared with BR/EDR connections.  Since PSKEY_MAX_ACLS determines
	the amount of RAM to allocate for BR/EDR connections, the value of
	PSKEY_BLE_MAX_LINKS should be less than or equal to PSKEY_MAX_ACLS.
	
	It is suggested that this is only changed after consulting CSR.

NAME
	PSKEY_LC_INQUIRY_PRIORITY (0x22c0)

SUMMARY
	Change BR/EDR inquiry and BLE scan priority

TYPE
	uint16

DEFAULT VALUE

ENUM_INCLUDE_FILE
	io_bt.h

ENUM_VALUES
	NORMAL_PRIORITY   inquiry and BLE scan scheduled at normal priority (0)
	   LOW_PRIORITY   inquiry and BLE scan scheduled at lowered priority (1)

DESCRIPTION
	If set to 0 then inquiry and BLE scanning are scheduled at the normal
	priority level. If set to 1 then scheduling priority of BR/EDR inquiry
	and BLE scanning is lowered. 
	
	Note that both settings of this key can give undesirable performance 
	in some circumstances. This key allows only a choice of which  
	scenarios are affected. It is possible that with low priority level 
	no inquiry or BLE scan results are received when doing a high speed
	file transfer. It is possible that at normal priority level,
	glitches are heard on a headset while doing inquiry.
	 
	A BCCMD inquiry_priority is available to change the priority level
	between low and normal at runtime. This PSKey allows the priority 
	level to be set at boot time.

DESCRIPTION
	This table contains an array of entries which configures the chip
	for a given output power, under both BDR and EDR conditions. It
	supersedes PSKEY_LC_POWER_TABLE and PSKEY_LC_ENHANCED_POWER_TABLE.
	
	The chip has an internal power amplifier (PA) which has a gain
	control. TX PA attenuators (tx_pa_atten) are present on BlueCore4
	audio variants, BlueCore5 and later devices.
	
	The power table stored under this PSKey provides a mapping between
	the gain settings of the various amplifiers and the corresponding
	transmit power. This table is the basis for all of the firmware's
	transmit power control: LMP dynamic power control,
	PSKEY_LC_MAX_TX_POWER, PSKEY_LC_DEFAULT_TX_POWER, etc.
	
	Every module design must have an appropriate power table.  The
	default value suits the CSR Casira hardware; this is not suitable
	for other module designs.
	
	The PSKey's value is an array of "enhanced_power_setting" typed
	elements.  The array's length is not fixed; typically an array is
	between 1 and 10 elements long.
	
	The "enhanced_power_setting" type holds eight bytes within five
	uint16 words.
	
	The first and second words control basic data rate (BDR) operation.
	
	        1st uint16, lower byte: high 4 bits - TX mixer level for BDR.
	                                low 4 bits - TX mixer offset for BDR.
	        1st uint16, upper byte: uint8 internal_pa for BDR.
	        2nd uint16, lower byte: bits 4 to 6 control the tx_pa_attn
	                                value. Unused bits must be zero.
	        2nd uint16, upper byte: This value must be zero.
	
	
	The third and fourth words control enhanced data rate (EDR) operation.
	Their form mirrors that of the first and second words.  
	
	        3rd uint16, lower byte: high 4 bits - TX mixer level for EDR.
	                                low 4 bits - TX mixer offset for EDR.
	        3rd uint16, upper byte: uint8 internal_pa for EDR.
	        4th uint16, lower byte: Bit 0 inhibits use of this power with
	                                EDR (see below). Bit 1 inhibits use
	                                of this power with BR (see below).
	                                Bits 4 to 6 control the tx_pa_attn
	                                value. Unused bits must be zero.
	        4th uint16, upper byte: This value must be zero.
	
	The fifth word specifies the output power - common to both data rates.
	
	        5th uint16, lower byte: set to zero.
	        5th uint16, upper byte: int8 tx dBm
	
	As an example, the element { 0x0d12, 0x0000, 0x3f12, 0x0000, 0xf800 }
	specifies:
	
	    To get power output -8 dBm for basic data rate (1 Mbps) use
	        internal amp 13, TX mixer level 1, TX mixer offset 2.
	    To get power output -8 dBm for enhanced data rate (2 or 3 Mbps)
	        use internal amp 63, TX mixer level 1, TX mixer offset 2.
	
	A power table is a list of these elements.  The elements must be
	sequenced in ascending order of output power.
	
	If the table contains only one element (five uint16s) then the
	firmware will use those settings for all power levels.
	
	The firmware responds to peer requests to increase/decrease transmit
	power by stepping up and down this table. The Bluetooth specification
	constrains the sizes and number of steps, which in turn bounds the
	size and content of the power table.
	
	In EDR operation, if the bottom bit of the fourth word is set, the 
	power is marked as unavailable for EDR transmissions. Depending on 
	the setting of BCCMD Limit_EDR_Power, the chip will either change the
	packet type table to basic rate; or refuse peer power control requests
	which request it to exceed the maximum allowed EDR power. If 
	PSKEY_LC_DEFAULT_TX_POWER is greater than the maximum allowed EDR
	power, BlueCore will refuse to enter use EDR until the peer requests
	it to decrement its power sufficiently, after which it will attempt to
	change the packet type table to use EDR.
	If any of the powers is marked as unavailable for EDR transmissions
	an equal number of powers have to marked as unavailable for BR
	transmissions by setting bit 1 of the fourth word.
	This is to make sure that while talking to devices that don't
	support enhanced power control (EPC), the power table has an equal
	number of power steps for both BR and EDR.
	Note: If the maximum transmit power has been modified via
	PSKEY_LC_MAX_TX_POWER or the VM trap VmTransmitPowerSetMaximum
	then care must be taken to ensure that the number of powers marked
	as unavailable for EDR transmissions is still equal to the number
	of powers marked as unavailable for BR transmissions.

	HOSTIO_TXSIGNAL_ASSERT_PIO_HIGH   Assert PIO high until end of data
	 HOSTIO_TXSIGNAL_ASSERT_PIO_LOW   Assert PIO low until end of data

DESCRIPTION
	This key can be set to cause BlueCore to signal its host transport
	transmit status via a PIO when using BCSP and H5.
	
	Depending on the value selected BlueCore will either toggle a PIO
	after each packet is transmitted over the host interface, or will
	keep a PIO in one state (high or low) while data is being
	transmitted and then set the PIO to the other state once no more data
	is available to transmit.
	
	The PIO is selected via PSKEY_HOST_TX_SIGNAL_PIO.
	
	This functionality is only available when BCSP or H5 are selected as
	the transport and only in the BlueTooth stack not in the DFU loader.

SUMMARY
	Coex Module: Input Pull Control

TYPE
	uint16[]

DEFAULT VALUE
	{ 0, 0, 0 }

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKEY is used to control the Input Pull Control on the
	input signals associated with Bluetooth/IEEE 802.11 coexistence.
	
	The first parameter (uint16) is a bitmask.  For each bit in this 
	parameter the corresponding PIO will be put into "bus-keeper" mode.  
	If the bit is not set, "bus-keeper" mode will not be enabled for 
	that PIO.
	
	The second parameter (uint16) is a bitmask.  This mask applies for all
	Bluetooth/IEEE 802.11 input PIO pins.  Normally, all input pins have a
	pull device (either up or down).  When the corresponding bit is clear 
	in this parameter, the pull is disabled leaving the pin in a 
	tri-state.
	
	The third parameter (uint16) is a bitmask.  This mask applies for all
	Bluetooth/IEEE 802.11 input PIO pins.  When the corresponding pin has
	pull control enabled, the value of the corresponding bit in this 
	parameter will determine whether the pull direction is up (1) 
	or down (0).
	
	See PSKEY_BCSP_PULL_CONTROL for more information on the pull device
	control features.
	
	On firmware which supports it, this PS key is deprecated in favour
	of PSKEY_COEX_WLAN_DENY_PULL_STATE which can be used to control the
	pulls of the WLAN_DENY PIO regardless of which PIO it's on.
	The values in this key are obeyed if PIO is lower than 16 and 
	PSKEY_COEX_WLAN_DENY_PULL_STATE is not set.

NAME
	PSKEY_COEX_EXTENDED_ABORT_DISABLE (0x2492)

SUMMARY
	Coex Module:  Extended Abort Disable

TYPE
	bool

DEFAULT VALUE
	(FALSE) 

DESCRIPTION
	This PSKEY is currently used to disable the aborting of AFH band 
	scan operations and conditional scan operations by the WLAN_Deny 
	signal in Unity-3 and derived schemes.
	
	In antenna switching architectures, there is the risk of incorrect
	readings for band scan and conditional scan if the antenna is 
	switched to the IEEE 802.11 device.  Through the use of the 
	WLAN_Deny signal, the PTA can indicate that the operation should 
	not take place when the antenna has been switched. For this purpose, 
	this PSKEY should be set to FALSE. 
	
	This PSKEY should be set to TRUE in systems that use the WLAN_Deny 
	signal as a "transmission enable" (holding the signal high). In this 
	case, the designated operation would be permanently disabled if the 
	WLAN_Deny signal was used as an abort indication.  This would be 
	incorrect behaviour.
	
	Note that this key is generic for exceptional operations that risk
	incorrect behaviour due to the PTA use of the WLAN_Deny signal.  Its 
	application may extend beyond band scan and conditional scan in the
	future.
	
	This key replaces PSKEY_LC_COMBO_DOT11_ABORT_BANDSCAN.

DESCRIPTION
	Adds finer granularity (1/32 ms) to PSKEY_CLOCK_STARTUP_DELAY. 
	The total startup delay is (PSKEY_CLOCK_STARTUP_DELAY 
	+ PSKEY_CLOCK_STARTUP_DELAY_FINE_ADJUSTMENT/32) ms.
	
	Notes:
	
	 * the existing special case (PSKEY_CLOCK_STARTUP_DELAY=0 giving a 
	   delay of 5 ms) becomes PSKEY_CLOCK_STARTUP_DELAY=0 and 
	   PSKEY_CLOCK_STARTUP_DELAY_FINE_ADJUSTMENT=0, and still gives a 
	   delay of 5 ms.
	 * whilst PSKEY_CLOCK_STARTUP_DELAY_FINE_ADJUSTMENT has units 
	   of 1/32 ms, current hardware restrictions mean that only 1/8 ms 
	   (rounded down) granularity is possible in practice.
	
	Examples:
	
	With PSKEY_CLOCK_STARTUP_DELAY=0, if 
	PSKEY_CLOCK_STARTUP_DELAY_FINE_ADJUSTMENT is:
	
	 * unset - delay 5 ms (special case, as before). 
	 * 12 - delay 0.375 ms (not recommended). 
	
	With PSKEY_CLOCK_STARTUP_DELAY=2
	PSKEY_CLOCK_STARTUP_DELAY_FINE_ADJUSTMENT is:
	
	 * 24 - delay 2.75 ms.

NAME
	PSKEY_ANA_FTRIM_OFFSET (0x2593)

SUMMARY
	Trim offset to crystal frequency

TYPE
	int16

MINIMUM
	-300

MAXIMUM
	300

DEFAULT VALUE
	(0)

DESCRIPTION
	This key specifies an offset to the crystal frequency specified in
	PSKEY_ANA_FREQ. The value is a signed 2's complement 16 bit integer
	which specifies the fractional part of the ratio between the true
	crystal frequency and the value in PSKEY_ANA_FREQ. This adjustment is
	intended to allow for small variations between individual crystals.
	
	To calculate the value of the key, a measurement of an actual
	frequency is required.
	
	Typically, a proxy for the crystal frequency is obtained by using the
	TXSTART radiotest (see "BCCMD Commands") to make the Bluetooth radio
	output a continuous wave at a specified frequency. Because the radio
	output frequency is proportional to the crystal frequency, the offset
	can be derived by comparing the radio frequency output when this key
	is zero (the default value) with the frequency you requested. The
	output radio frequency is usually measured with a spectrum analyser.
	
	The value of this key is in parts per 2^20, so the correct offset is
	
	((actual/requested) - 1) * 2^20
	
	For example, if you requested a continuous wave at 2402 MHz and the
	output frequency with this key set to zero was 2402.0168 MHz, you
	would set this key to 7. If the output was 2401.9832 MHz, you would
	set this key to -7, value 0xfff9.
	
	If you happen to measure the RF output frequency with this key set
	to a non-zero value, the calculated offset can simply be added to 
	the current value of the key.
	
	This key replaces PSKEY_ANA_FTRIM on some BlueCore7 parts. To
	determine whether you have such a part, either look at the PSKeys.txt
	or pskeys.html file released with the firmware (which only lists keys
	which are valid for that firmware) or connect PSTool to the chip
	(since PSTool only lists keys which the chip knows are valid).

NAME
	PSKEY_SELECT_CLOCK_OUTPUT_PIO (0x2594)

SUMMARY
	Clock output PIO

TYPE
	uint16

DEFAULT VALUE
	(0xFFFF)

DESCRIPTION
	This key specifies the clock output PIO pin number and can be set to
	any available PIO in the range 0-31 as follows -
	
	If a frequency derived from the internal clock is to be used, set
	this to an even numbered PIO.
	If the XTAL frequency is to be used, set this to an odd numbered PIO.
	
	Note that setting this key to the value 0xFFFF (the default value) or
	an invalid PIO number, disables the output.
	
	See PSKEY_SELECT_CLOCK_OUTPUT_SOURCE to select the clock source.
	See PSKEY_SELECT_CLOCK_OUTPUT_RATE to select the output frequency
	derived from the internal clock.

==============================================================================
NAME
	PSKEY_SELECT_CLOCK_OUTPUT_RATE (0x2595)

SUMMARY
	Clock output rate

TYPE
	uint16

DEFAULT VALUE
	(0)

DESCRIPTION
	This key determines the output frequency for a clock derived from the
	internal clock.  The output frequency will be 80MHz divided by the
	value of the key with an additional divide-by-2 (this ensures an even
	duty cycle).  For example, a key value of 0x0001 will result in an
	output frequency of 40MHz, while 0x0002 yields 20MHz.
	The extra divide-by-2 can be switched off by setting Bit 15 of the
	key to 1.  For example, 0x8001 yields 80MHz output, while 0x8002
	results in 40MHz.  This allows frequencies such as 16MHz to be
	selected.  For values greater than 0x8001, the resulting output no
	longer has an even duty cycle, and the skewed mark:space ratio is
	approximately 1:(n-1), where n is the key value ignoring 
	Bit 15, and n > 1.
	
	Note 
	Setting this key to the value 0 (the default value) disables clock 
	output.
	This key has no effect if the XTAL frequency has been selected for 
	output.
	
	See PSKEY_SELECT_CLOCK_OUTPUT_SOURCE to select the clock source.
	See PSKEY_SELECT_CLOCK_OUTPUT_PIO to select the output PIO.

DESCRIPTION
	Configures the crystal oscillator parameters on some parts.
	
	Bits used:
	 1,0:  crystal oscillator capacitive loading in LP mode
	 3,2:  crystal oscillator capacitive loading in normal mode
	 
	Where 00 is maximum capacitance and 11 the minimum in each 2 bit
	binary field.  Also see PSKEY_LP_XTAL_LVL for LP mode.
	
	You must consult the relevant documentation specific to ascertain
	what specific options are applicable to the part in use.
	
	LP mode value should be greater than or equal to normal mode.
	 
	It is suggested that this is only changed after consulting CSR
	
	Note:  On parts where this key is operative is it not intended for
	fine frequency tuning, it is only to establish reliable / low power
	operation.  Frequency trimming is accomplished by using
	PSKEY_ANA_FTRIM_OFFSET

NAME
	PSKEY_SMPS_FREQ_OFFSET (0x25a0)

SUMMARY
	SMPS frequency offset from 4MHz

TYPE
	int8

MINIMUM
	-3

MAXIMUM
	3

DEFAULT VALUE
	(0)

DESCRIPTION
	This 8-bit key, if it exists, specifies an offset from the default
	switcher frequency for the SMPS's. The value is a signed 2's 
	complement 8 bit integer, and is applied at power-up and is a single
	value for both SMPS's. In the chip, both SMPS's are clocked from the
	same source, which is a divided-down version of the 80MHz Dig PLL.
	This key simply modifies that division value from the default 
	value of 9. This divided-down clock is only used for the SMPS's.
	
	The frequency fed into both SMPS's is calculated as:
	
	f = FdigPLL / (( DefaultDiv + 1 + PSKEY_SMPS_FREQ_OFFSET ) * 2 )
	
	  where typically FdigPLL is 80MHz, and DefaultDiv = 9
	
	So for a PSKEY_SMPS_FREQ_OFFSET = 0 the SMPS's are clocked at 4MHz
	
	For example, if you wanted the switchers to run at 4.4444 MHz you
	would set this ket to -1, value 0xff. If you wanted 3.6363 MHz
	you would set this key to +1, value 0x01.
	
	The MIN and MAX values keep the Freq in the range 3.07Mhz - 5.72 MHz
	This key should not be altered except on specific advice from CSR.

	an external transistor and resistor.  The value of the resistor sets
	the charge current and the transistor typically can pass a much larger
	current than the internal on-chip charger can supply.
	
	This is an initial setting that can be overridden by a VM trap.

NAME
	PSKEY_CAP_SENSE_CALIBRATE (0x25b1)

SUMMARY
	Cap Sense Calibrate

TYPE
	uint16

DEFAULT VALUE
	0

DESCRIPTION
	This key, when non-zero, calibrates the cap sense hardware against 
	the stray capacitance of the product.  It is reset to zero when
	calibration is complete.  The calibration results are written to
	other PSKEYs, which are subsequently loaded each time the product
	powers up.  For a successful calibration, the touch pads must not
	be touched or close to anything that may affect the capacitance of
	the pads.
	
	To calibrate, use this key as a bit field of pads that are to be
	used in the product (and hence included in the calibration process).
	For example if the product uses pads 2-4, set this key to 0x1C and
	reboot the chip - calibration typically takes a few seconds.  When
	using PSTool, it will succeed in reconnecting when the calibration
	process is complete.
	
	If PSKEY_CAP_SENSE_SHIELD is TRUE, Bit 0 of this key is ignored.
	
	Calibration results are stored to PSKEY_CAP_SENSE_BULK_CAP and
	PSKEY_CAP_SENSE_PRELOAD.  PSKEY_CAP_SENSE_PRELOAD contains a value
	for each pad.  A zero value indicates that the pad has not been
	calibrated.  A complete set of zeros indicates that the calibration
	failed.  This is likely because two pads have radically different
	capacitances and there is no single range the system can use that
	includes both values.

NAME
	PSKEY_ENABLE_SOFT_WD (0x25c0)

SUMMARY
	Enable watchdog's soft/debug mode

TYPE
	bool

DEFAULT VALUE
	(FALSE)

DESCRIPTION
	This key is intended as debug aid to find background-lockup problems
	after the watchdog has been disabled by the test systems.
	
	When FALSE, the watchdog works normally.
	
	When TRUE, it is treated as a "soft" watchdog, in the sense that
	it does not cause the chip to reset even when fired. The exact 
	mechanism differs between pre-BlueCore7 chips and BlueCore7+:
	
	On pre-BlueCore7 (pre-Jemima) chips, if this key is set to TRUE and 
	watchdog is disabled (by setting PSKEY_WD_TIMEOUT = 0),
	the watchdog kicks will continue to be scheduled as usual every 
	PSKEY_WD_PERIOD. But instead of kicking the hardware, it will take
	a timestamp and compare it with the last such timestamp. 
	A difference of more than twice of PSKEY_WD_PERIOD will cause 
	a fault to be raised (FAULT_WATCHDOG_KICK_TOO_LATE), which may be 
	converted to a panic by setting PSKEY_PANIC_ON_FAULT. 
	Note that PSKEY_WD_TIMEOUT should be 0 to enable this soft mode. 
	If PSKEY_WD_TIMEOUT != 0, this key is ignored and the watchdog is 
	active.
	
	On BlueCore7 onwards, if this key is set to TRUE the watchdog will 
	fire if timeout happens. However it will only halt the chip, not 
	cause a reset. This is actually a special mode of the watchdog, 
	unlike the previous case where it was purely a software mechanism.
	Note that in this case, PSKEY_WD_TIMEOUT should be nonzero to enable 
	this mode. If PSKEY_WD_TIMEOUT == 0, this key is ignored 
	and the watchdog is disabled.
