@brief	Header file for the Serial Port Profile Server

        This library implements the Serial Port Profile (SPP) specification for
        a server side connection (Device B, Acceptor). SPP can be used to emulate
        a serial port connection using RFCOMM between two peer devices.
		
        The library exposes a functional downstream API and an upstream message
        based API.
