DESCRIPTION 

    Header file for the Audio/Video Remote Control Profile library.  This
    profile library implements the AVRCP using the services of the AVCTP
    library which is hidden from the Client application by this library
    
    The library exposes a functional downstream API and an upstream message 
    based API.

@file    avrcp.h
@brief    Interface to the Audio Video Remote Control Profile library.

        This profile library implements the AVRCP.  This library permits one
        device known as the controller (CT) to send dedicated user actions to
        another device known as the target (TG).
        
        Note: This library does not handle audio streaming, this is implemented
        in the GAVDP library.
    
        The library exposes a functional downstream API and an upstream message
        based API.
